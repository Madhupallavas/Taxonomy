For example, I use <code>&lt;C-b&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;Right&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;C-h&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;BS&gt;</code>. On Stack Overflow/Super User they produce <code>**strong text**</code> and <code>## Heading ##</code> respectively. I do not want this happen.

6034197,Nodes inside Cisco VPN. Incoming SSH requests allowed. But can't initiate an outbound SSH,"<p>I've a gateway-to-gateway VPN setup between my Linksys RV042 router and a Cisco VPN. </p>

<p>I am able to SSH into any of the machine inside the VPN from my network. But none of the machines inside the VPN can initiate an SSH into my network. It seems they've blocked even all ping requests to my network gateway.</p>

<p>This is the requirement: I have scripts that SSH into the machines inside the VPN and run a long mysql query. The query generates an output to a file. The time that these queries take is variable. So I have a loop in my machine that periodically SSHes into the VPN machine and checks if the query has finished, and pulls the generated file using SCP. </p>

<p>I need to simplify it thus: The script will run at the machine inside the VPN, and when the query completes, it will SSH into my machine and pushes the generated file.</p>

<p>Thanks for any ideas.      </p>

6034203,URL Rewriting from Winforms or console application,"<p>I'm importing classic ASP pages into a new Sitefinity installation. Unfortunately, the existing site makes extensive use of URL rewriting via Helicon ISAPI Rewrite 3.</p>

<p>I'm generating the list of pages that need to be imported by crawling the navigation menus in the old site. These are, unfortunately, <em>not</em> dynamically generated from any sort of central repository, so the best way I've found to build the site hierarchy is to crawl the site.</p>

<p>When creating page nodes in the Sitefinity nav hierarchy to hold the content from the old pages, I need to be able to create the new pages at a location roughly equivelant to their location in the file system in the old site. However, the rewrite rules make this difficult to determine. For instance, I may get a link form parsing the old HTML like:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.mysite.com/product_name
</code></pre>

<p>which is rewritten (not redirected) to</p>

<pre><code>http://www.mysite.com/products/product_name/product_root.asp
</code></pre>

<p>I need a way to get the second url from the first. The first thing that comes to mind is to somehow use the <code>.htaccess</code> file to parse the URLs, get the result and use that for the rest of the import process. </p>

<p>Is there a way to do this from a Winforms app without having to involve a web server? I realize that I could modify one of the ASP includes, such as the page footer, to emit a comment containing the rewritten URL of each page, but I'd rather not make unnecessary changes to the existing code if it can be avoided.</p>

6034204,Create Non-Culture Based ResourceManager for ASP.Net,"<p>I am working on an ASP.Net application that is company specific in that when users login, they login using their username, password and company id.  I am trying to find the best way to allow each company to customize certain labels within the software.  For instance, there is a field that we globally call ""Unique Identifier"".  On a per company basis, they may want to rename the field to be ""Employee Badge Number"", ""HR Id Code"" or whatever every they want.  I was looking at possibly extending the ResourceProvider to using a DB instead of the RESX files, however, it seems like the ResourceProvider is heavily based on culture/languages changes rather than customization.</p>

<p>Has anyone developed similar functionality in an application?  Did you extend the ResourceProvider or go the completely custom route?</p>

<p>I have been searching for possible solutions all week and am coming up dry.  My fall back is to just create something completely custom, but I worry about losing out of the building efficiency of the ResourceProvider.</p>

In order to implement a read-only iterator, you have to provide an implementation for 2 of those: <code>hasNext</code> and <code>next</code>.</p>

<p>My problem is that these methods does not declare any exceptions. So if my code inside the iteration process declares exceptions, I must enclose my iteration code inside a try/catch block.</p>

<p>My current policy has been to rethrow the exception enclosed in a <code>RuntimeException</code>. But this has issues because the checked exceptions are lost and the client code no longer can catch those exceptions explicitly.</p>

<p>Here is a sample code for clarity:</p>

6034231,How to validate lambda expressions against null references?,"<p>I have a method that accepts a generic delegate as a parameter, and inserts it in a list:</p>

<pre><code>public void AddFilterMember&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; filterMember)
{
    filter.Add(filterMember);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Later on all delegates are invoked over an instance of type <strong>T</strong> to find out if this instance passes the filter, i.e, if <strong>true</strong> is returned for every <strong>filterMember</strong> invoked.</p>

<p>I noticed that it is possible to pass an invalid lambda expression like the following:</p>

<pre><code>string str = null;
AddFilterMember(x =&gt; str.Contains((string)x));
</code></pre>

<p>Which obviously will throw an exception when invoked because the <strong>str</strong> string is null. So I would like to know the best way to validate a lambda expression against null references (other than its parameters) at the moment it is defined?</p>

<p>I guess one option would be to invoke it using a default instance of T, but sometimes this is not feasible because T may not have a default parameterless constructor.</p>

6034232,secure hash as database table key,"<p>I have a database table that is populated by a long running process. This process reads external data and updates the records in the database. Instead of really updating the records, it is easier to cascade-delete them and recreate. This way all the dependencies will be cleaned up too.</p>

<p>Each record has a unique name. I need to find a way to generate identifiers for these records in such a way that the same names are identified by the same identifiers. So that the identifier stays the same when the record is deleted and recreated. I tried using slugs but they can become very long and Django's SlugField does not always work.</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to use a secure hash as the key? I could create a hash from the slug and use that. Or is it too expensive?</p>

<p>Ultimately i'd like the function to return a subset of the permuatations specified by lbound and ubound arguments, and to do so I think i need someway to keep an internal count.</p>

<p>Using the size of the returned queue will not work since i'd like the function to be able to handle permutations too big to hold in memory.</p>

<p>For this code i'd like the count to be returned as 100.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;;

using namespace std;

int&amp; Permutations(vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; param, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; &amp;perm, int index=0)
{
    static vector&lt;int&gt; iter;
    static int count = 0;

    if (index == param.size())
    {
        perm.push_back(iter);   // add permutation to queue
        count++;
        return count;
    }

    for (int i=param[index][0]; i&lt;=param[index][1]; i+=param[index][2])
    {
        if (iter.size() &gt; index) iter[index] = i;
        else iter.push_back(i);
        Permutations(param, perm, index+1); // recursive function
    }
}

void main()
{
    vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; params; // vector of parameter vectors

    vector&lt;int&gt; param1, param2;

    int arr1[3] = {0,9,1};  // range for each parameter vector
    int arr2[3] = {0,9,1};  // specified as lbound, ubound, step

6034248,Legality of COW std::string implementation in C++11,"<p>It had been my understanding that copy-on-write is not a viable way to implement a conforming std::string in C++11, but when it came up in discussion recently I found myself unable to directly support that statement.</p>

<p>Am I correct that C++11 does not admit COW based implementations of std::string?</p>

<p>If so, is this restriction explicitly stated somewhere in the new standard (where)?</p>

<p>Or is this restriction implied, in the sense that it is the combined effect of the new requirements on std::string that precludes a COW based implementation of std::string. In this case, I'd be interested in a chapter and verse style derivation of 'C++11 effectively prohibits COW based std::string implementations'.</p>
"
6034249,Calling an overridden function from a base class?,"<p>My question will probably be best explained by an example.</p>

<p>For example, I have 2 classes: A base class and a derived class:</p>

<pre><code>class baseClass
{
public:
    baseClass()
    {
        foo();
    }
    virtual bool foo() { printf(""baseClass""); return false;}

};

class derivedClass : public baseClass
{
public:
    bool foo()
    {
        printf(""derivedClass"");
        return true;
    }

};
</code></pre>

<p>When I create an instance of <code>derivedClass</code>, the constructor in <code>baseClass</code> will be called, and <code>foo()</code> will be called from it's constructor. The problem is, the baseClass' constructor is calling its own <code>foo()</code> and no the overridden <code>foo()</code> that the derived class has overridden. Is there anyway to make the baseClass call the overridden function, not it's own definition of the function?</p>

6034277,image analysis and 64bit OS,"<p>I developed a C# application that makes use of Congex vision library (VPro). My application is developed with Visual Studio 2008 Pro on a 32bit Windows PC with 3GB of RAM.</p>

So far so good, but when I add many and many vision elaboration the memory allocation increases and a part  of application (only Cognex OCX) stops working well. The rest of application stills to work (working threads, com on socket....)</p>

<p>I did whatever I could to save memory, but when the memory allocated is about 700MB I begin to have the problems.

<li>If I don't need to recompile my application, can I link it with 64bit Congnex library? </li>

6034279,XML catalog in Eclipse WTP: How do you reference a standalone XML schema,"<p>I have an XML schema document (provided by a company I deal with) to validate a certain XML file that is required for their system.</p>

<p>Lets say the first couple of lines of the schema look like this (I have modified the URIs to protect the guilty!):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""
elementFormDefault=""qualified""
targetNamespace=""http://www.example.com/manifest-plugin""
xmlns=""http://www.example.com/manifest-plugin""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The URI in the XSD is not valid in the unmodified original i.e. you cannot go there to get a copy of this XSD file. I have no idea why they haven't published it at the URL defined in the XSD, but they haven't.</p>

<p>I have a local copy of the XSD which I would like to use to validate the XML file I create using the features of Eclipse's XML catalog. Obviously, as the URI is invalid there is no point to let the system try to retrieve the XSD from the web.</p>

<p>Let's say the local XSD file lives on my local drive here:</p>

<pre><code>C:\xml_schemas\manifest-plugin.xsd
</code></pre>

<p>And the opening two lines of the XML file look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;manifest&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Could anyone give an example of how to do this?</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>What values do I set in the XML catalog dialog boxes in Eclipse, based on the values I have provided above?</li>
<li>What do I put into the XML file to get it to validate against the local XSD, without confusing other systems which my read my XML file down the line?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have found this page on the Eclipse wiki, but I personally don't find the instructions very clear:-</p>

<p><a href=""http://wiki.eclipse.org/Using_the_XML_Catalog"" rel=""nofollow"">Using the XML catalog in Eclipse</a></p>

<p>I have tried setting the XML catalog parameters thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Location : C:\xml_schemas\manifest-plugin.xsd</li>
<li>Key type : Namespace name</li>
<li>Key : <a href=""http://www.example.com/manifest-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.example.com/manifest-plugin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Then adding </p>

<pre><code>&lt;manifest xmlns:targetNamespace=""http://www.example.com/manifest-plugin""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to the XML file, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>By the way, if your version of Eclipse doesn't have the XML catalog, you probably haven't got the ""web tools platform (WTP)"" features installed. They come with the JEE version of Eclipse, but can be installed separately.</p>

6034280,add an extra link to preview your object in a Django admin form,"<p>In my django application we are enabling our client to customize their web page.
In order to do that I created a model to generate the template and it is actually working fine. My problem is that I would like to add a preview link into the admin form.
This way I could do ""Save and continue editing"" to save the template and if I want I could click this link to preview it while editing the page.</p>

<p>I already activated the preview from the List display but I want this field to show into the form directly.</p>

          return ""preview/%i/"" % self.id

<p>This is working but is there a way to add it directly in the update form?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I got it working by following the main idea in this question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3874231/adding-an-extra-button-to-one-object-in-django-admin"">Adding an extra button to one object in django admin</a></p>

<p>I finally added the javascript file in the admin configuration of my model and I wrote a javascript function to generate the url of the preview object.  I had to wrote a view to display the preview has I wished. The difference with the solution on the post was that I did a Button instead of a submit input, plus my javascript open a pop up of the preview page. So you still stay in the admin interface where you can update the model as you wish while previewing your changes.</p>

"
6034288,Architecture for a business objects / database access layer,"<p>For various reasons, we are writing a new business objects/data storage library. One of the requirements of this layer is to separate the logic of the business rules, and the actual data storage layer. </p>

<p>It is possible to have multiple data storage layers that implement access to the same object - for example, a main ""database"" data storage source that implements most objects, and another ""ldap"" source that implements a User object. In this scenario, User can optionally come from an LDAP source, perhaps with slightly different functionality (eg, not possible to save/update the User object), but otherwise it is used by the application the same way. Another data storage type might be a web service, or an external database.</p>

<p>There are two main ways we are looking at implementing this, and me and a co-worker disagree on a fundamental level which is correct. I'd like some advice on which one is the best to use. I'll try to keep my descriptions of each as neutral as possible, as I'm looking for some objective view points here. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Business objects are base classes, and data storage objects inherit business objects. Client code deals with data storage objects.</p>

<p>In this case, common business rules are inherited by each data storage object, and it is the data storage objects that are directly used by the client code. </p>

<p>This has the implication that client code determines which data storage method to use for a given object, because it has to explicitly declare an instance to that type of object. Client code needs to explicitly know connection information for each data storage type it is using.</p>

<p>If a data storage layer implements different functionality for a given object, client code explicitly knows about it at compile time because the object looks different. If the data storage method is changed, client code has to be updated.</p></li>
<li><p>Business objects encapsulate data storage objects.</p>

<p>In this case, business objects are directly used by client application. Client application passes along base connection information to business layer. Decision about which data storage method a given object uses is made by business object code. Connection information would be a chunk of data taken from a config file (client app does not really know/care about details of it), which may be a single connection string for a database, or several pieces connection strings for various data storage types. Additional data storage connection types could also be read from another spot - eg, a configuration table in a database that specifies URLs to various web services. </p>

<p>The benefit here is that if a new data storage method is added to an existing object, a configuration setting can be set at runtime to determine which method to use, and it is completely transparent to the client applications. Client apps do not need to be modified if data storage method for a given object changes. </p></li>
<li><p>Business objects are base classes, data source objects inherit from business objects. Client code deals primarily with base classes.</p>

<p>This is similar to the first method, but client code declares variables of the base business object types, and Load()/Create()/etc static methods on the business objects return the appropriate data source-typed objects. </p>

<p>The architecture of this solution is similar to the first method, but the main difference is the decision about which data storage object to use for a given business object is made by the business layer, not the client code. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are already existing ORM libraries that provide some of this functionality, but please discount those for now (there is the possibility that a data storage layer is implemented with one of these ORM libraries) - also note I'm deliberately not telling you what language is being used here, other than that it is strongly typed.</p>

<p>I'm looking for some general advice here on which method is better to use (or feel free to suggest something else), and why. </p>

<br>
<br>
Can anyone kindly help me by telling how where can I find it and what are the steps to apply the validation on my form fields.
<br>
<br>
I also saw there was a Validation API JAR file and I downloaded and included it in my project. It provided 3 controls (or whatever I should say); ""ValidationPanel"", ""ValidationUtils"" and ""Problems"". I saw an example at a website &amp; followed it. I dragged-and-dropped the ""ValidationPanel"" and wrote the code as shown in following code</p>

<pre><code>final ValidationGroup group = validationPanel1.getValidationGroup();

group.add(txtUserName, Validators.REQUIRE_NON_EMPTY_STRING,
Validators.NO_WHITESPACE,
Validators.REQUIRE_VALID_INTEGER);

<p>But it seems JAR file contains incomplete files or there may be other problem, because it gives error: cannot find symbol: variable ""Validators""

I am sorry I think these are 2 questions, but kindly help me how to solve it.

6034300,Adding more prototype cells to iOS storyboard than fit in viewcontroller dimensions?,"<p>I'm working on an iOS project with storyboards and have run into a problem I can't readily solve.</p>

<p>It's a basic viewcontroller that contains a tableview with custom cells. I have 5 prototype cells varying in height between 70 - 160 pixels and that's all fine - but I now need to add in some more prototypes and my issue is that there is no screen space for them - so I can't work on the design.</p>

<p>I imagined there would be a way to layout the storyboard such that the prototype cells can be displayed where I want them, rather than being visually constrained inside the view controller - which is rather limiting to put it mildly, but I can't figure out how to do it and the documentation seems to avoid the issue.</p>

<p>This graphic hopefully clarifies - I want to add new prototypes but they don't fit in the VC frame and so I can't edit them :-(</p>

6034315,nginx real_ip_header and X-Forwarded-For seems wrong,"<p>The wikipedia description of the HTTP header <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>X-Forwarded-For: client1, proxy1, proxy2, ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The nginx documentation for the directive <code>real_ip_header</code> reads, in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This directive sets the name of the header used for transferring the replacement IP address.<br>
  In case of X-Forwarded-For, this module uses the <strong>last</strong> ip in the X-Forwarded-For header for replacement.  [Emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two descriptions seem at odds with one another.  In our scenario, the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header is exactly as described -- the client's ""real"" IP address is the left-most entry.  Likewise, the behavior of nginx is to use the <em>right</em>-most value -- which, obviously, is just one of our proxy servers.  </p>

<p>My understanding of <code>X-Real-IP</code> is that it is <em>supposed</em> to be used to determine the <em>actual</em> client IP address -- <em>not</em> the proxy.  Am I missing something, or is this a bug in nginx?</p>

<p>And, beyond that, does anyone have any suggestions for how to make the <code>X-Real-IP</code> header display the <em>left</em>-most value, as indicated by the definition of <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>?</p>

6034325,posix semaphore trouble,"<p>I supposed that my program should work like this:
1) initializing unnamed semaphore with value = 0
the second value for <code>sem_init</code>(..) is 1 so as it said in MAN the semaphore is shared between processes
2) creating child, child waits until semaphore value becomes 1</p>

<p>parent process increases the value of semaphore so the child should exit now
but it doesn't exit really, so that is the problem</p>

6034331,Roots with equal fractional parts,"<p><em><strong>Question.</em></strong> <em>¿Does there exist an integer $n&gt;1$ such that there exist positive integers $a,b$ such that $\{\sqrt[n]{a}\}=\{\sqrt[n]{b}\},a\neq b$ and $a$ and $b$ aren't perfect n-th powers? ( $\{x\}$ is the fractional part of $x$)</em></p>

<p>Here is what i've done so far. First we start with a tricky lemma:</p>

<p><em><strong>Lemma.</em></strong> <em>If $z$ is a root of the polynomial $ax^2+bx+c=0$ with $b\neq0$($a$ can be $0$) and for some positive integer $n$, $z^n\in \mathbb{Z}$ then $z\in\mathbb{Z}$.</em><br>
<strong><em>Proof.</em></strong> If $a=0\implies bz=-c\implies b^nz^n=(-c)^n\implies z^n$ is a n-th power from which $z^n=r^n$ for some $r\in\mathbb{Z}$, therefore $z=r\in\mathbb{Z}$.<br>
If $a\neq 0$ then we set $z=\frac{p\pm\sqrt{q}}{r}$ for some integers $p,q,r$ with $p,q\neq 0$. Then $zr=p\pm \sqrt{q}\implies z^nr^n=(p\pm\sqrt{q})^n=i+j\sqrt{q}$ for some integers $i,j$. If $q$ is a perfect square then $z$ is rational and since $z^n$ is integer, $z$ is also integer. If $q$ is not a perfect square then $j=0$ from which $(p\pm\sqrt{q})^n=i=(p\mp\sqrt{q})^n\implies |p\pm\sqrt{q}|=|p\mp\sqrt{q}|$ then $p=0$, which is impossible since $p=-b\neq0$, or $q=0$ but $q$ isn't a perfect square. In any case the lemma is proven.</p>

<p>Back to the problem. Suposse that for some integer $n&gt;1$, there exist positive integers $a,b,,m$ such that $a$ and $b$ aren't n-th powers and
$$\sqrt[n]{a}-\sqrt[n]{b}=m\quad{(*)}$$
Then
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt[n]{a}^2-\sqrt[n]{ab}&amp;=m\sqrt[n]{a}\\
\sqrt[n]{a}^2-m\sqrt[n]{a}-\sqrt[n]{ab}&amp;=0
\end{align*}$$
So if we prove that $\sqrt[n]{ab}$ is integer, then applying the lemma we conclude that the answer to the initial question is negative.</p>

<p>I'll prove that the answer is negative for $n=5$. Suppose that $(*)$ is true, then setting
$x:=\sqrt[5]{a}$ and $y:=\sqrt[5]{a}$:
$$\begin{align*}
x-y&amp;=m\\
x^5-5x^4y+10x^3y^2-10x^2y^3+5xy^4-y^5&amp;=m^5\\
-5xy(x^3-2x^2y+2xy^2-y^3)&amp;=m^5-x^5+y^5\\
-5xy((x-y)^3+x^2y-xy^2)&amp;=m^5-x^5+y^5\\
-5xy(m^3+mxy)&amp;=m^5-x^5+y^5\\
5mx^2y^2+5m^3xy+m^5-x^5+y^5&amp;=0
\end{align*}$$
Now we apply the lemma to $xy$ and we get that $xy$ is integer, so we are done.</p>

<p>Applying a similar argument to $n=2,3,4$ we get what we want. But when $n&gt;5$, we cannot use this trick anymore since we get a polynomial in $xy$ that has a degree greater than $2$.</p>

<p>I'd like to find an elementary answer to this question, but if you have some more advanced method don't hesitate in posting it.</p>

<p>So, my question is should I assign an Iteration to the tasks even through the User Stories have already been assigned an Iteration? And what should I do about ""general"" tasks that are not really associated with a User Story? For example, I could create a task that involves updating references for controls or performing a code review. Should these be assigned an Iteration and is it worthwhile managing two types of tasks, i.e. those assigned to User Stories and those that aren't?</p>

6034360,Solr: Populate Separate Fields from a Tokenizer,"<p>I've created a custom Tokenizer in Solr that looks for named entities.  I would like to be able to use this information to populate separate fields within the lucene/solr document.</p>

<p>As an example, I want to populate a multivalued field called, ""locations"" with all the location names that were extracted from the text.  To extract locations the text is first tokenized to separate the words and to determine which tokens are locations.  After this process, I would like to emit the tokens for the tokenizer, but also populate the field ""locations"" with all the location names that were extracted from the text.</p>

<p>From the research that I've done, there is no way to access the SolrDocument object from the Tokenizer or the TokenizerFactory so there is no way to populate fields from here.</p>

<p>The solution that I've come up with so far is to create a custom UpdateRequestProcessorFactory that processes the text and extracts the fields, and then the Tokenizer processes the text AGAIN to get the tokens.  I would like to find a way to be able to do this work and only process the text once. </p>

6034368,What hardware would I need (approx) to run ESXi server?,"<p>I am considering to purchase <strong>off-the-shelf commodity hardware</strong> in order to build server that will host virtual machines using ESXi server.</p>

<p>Intended <strong>purpose for this server is NOT mission critical</strong> tasks. It will have to run perhaps 20-50 Windows XP/Vista/7 virtual machines (in total, but closer to 20 figure). Each guest would have to have <strong>1-2 GB of ram</strong>, and probably two-three times more disk space than guest OS needs with clean install and all updates applied (that would be around <strong>6-8 GB for XP</strong>, and i believe closer to <strong>10-15 for win7</strong>). Those guests will act as a test ground for a new product that is network management software, thus guests will idle most of their time once initially loaded, but if I give them some task to complete, they should be able to perform reasonably well.</p>

<p>Now, from what I have learned... CPU is usually not much of an issue (6 cores would do it), memory should not be lacking, but doesn't have to be sum of all guests, because of overcommitment... That leads me to IO, which is, as it seems, the bottleneck.</p>

<p>Since I have very little experience with ESXi (and ESX, too) server, I'd like to ask:</p>

<ol>
<li>How much memory could I save by overcommitment, and how does it affect performance?</li>
<li>Is 6-core cpu enough to run above described system?</li>
<li>Would it be possible to run entire server off two (or even one) SSD drives (to host system virtual disks), with few additional HDDs (2-3) in RAID 0 to be used as secondary storage?</li>
<li>I read somewhere that ESXi allows having something like ""master image"", essentially virtual machine that is ""deployed"" many times, so that disk space can be saved by having only differences stored by specific guests, instead of copying around whole virtual disks. Is this true, and how can this help me?</li>
<li>Are there any other things I need to take into consideration when building this off-the-shelf solution?</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I should probably mention here that I'm fully aware of issues like SPOF regarding power supply, raid 0, etc, but since it's only a testing ground and not a production system, it's not so important for me.</em></p>

6034373,Flash fullscreen on secondary (bigger) screen doesn't work,"<p>I have a dual monitor setup, with a small (laptop) and a bigger screen. Whenever I watch a video on some streaming website, and click fullscreen, the video takes the resolution of the smaller screen (1366x768) but shows up on the big screen (1920x1080). The remaining space on the right and below the video is just grey. I, of course, want the video to be fullscreen on the bigger monitor, and not just 1366x768.</p>

<p>Note: This is <em>not</em> the problem where the fullscreen is always displayed on the primary monitor. For me, it doesn't matter whether the secondary monitor is primary or not and even if I switch off the smaller screen using xrandr, and only use the large monitor, the issue remains. I am not 100% sure if the video really takes 1366x768 but I guess it does. </p>

}

<p>As an addendum, is there a simpler way to make nice looking UIButtons? I don't have access to Photoshop at work (although I do have gimp installed), so a way which doesn't involve image making would be good. I can't believe that apple didn't supply nice looking UIButtons in the UI, it seems such a fundamental thing to need?</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the help mis amigos.</p>

<p>thanks for the answers...I've tried the fix but it still doesn't fire</p>

<p>I now have </p>

<pre><code>[read addTarget:self action:@selector(changeFilter:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
</code></pre>

<p>then </p>

-(void)changeFilter:(id)sender;
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>@implementation
-(void)changeFilter:(id)sender{}

<p>Note that the method is in the same class as the UISegmentedControl. Maybe I should just try using the Glass button API which was suggested, but my boss hates me using third party libraries if there is a way of avoiding it!</p>

6034392,Issue merging changes between multiple MOCs on new database,"<p>I have an IOS app that uses a core database to store
thumbnail photo images and their user selected rating.
I use multiple managed object contexts for this.</p>

<p>The problem is that when the app is installed and
launched for the first time (and thus creates a new
database) the main MOC does not see updates from the
temporary MOC that is making changes to the photo rating.
However on subsequent launches of the app (i.e. database
exists already), everything works fine each and every
time.</p>

<p>And additionally, on a new app launch, even though the
ratings don't show up in the main viewcontroller, I know
they're being saved to disk, because on a app re-launch
I see the ratings the user had entered.</p>

<p>The main MOC is a list view controller that displays the
photos. When the user selects a photo from the list, it
launches another view controller (with a temporary MOC
tied to the same persistent store) where the user selects
a photo rating. But on a fresh launch of the app, the photo
rating setting never propagates back to the list view controller.</p>

<p>I've included some code. Would appreciate any insights.</p>

<h2>Database creation in main listview controller</h2>

<pre><code>if ([fileManager fileExistsAtPath:[urlForPhotosDb path]]) {

if (photosDB.documentState == UIDocumentStateClosed) {

}];     
}
} else {

6034396,Using javascript with the twitter API,"<p>I'm interested in making a twitter client using Adobe Air, but I'm kinda stuck right now, as I can't figure out a better way to connect to the twitter REST API since it needs authentication.</p>

<p>Currently, the client sends a request to my server (a php script using curl) with the twitter username/password (unencrypted) in GET variables. The server then makes a request to twitter using those credentials and outputs the buffer, which gets sent back to the client, which then processes/displays it.</p>

<p>This obviously is a horrendous security hole, so does anyone know of a better (more secure) way of doing it? </p>

6034406,multiple instances of a class in wordpress plugin,"<p>I'm cross-posting this from the wordpress section, b/c I think the problem lies more in my lack of understanding of OOP, so maybe it should've been posted here in the first place.</p>

<p>In writing wordpress plugins I wanted to created a class that I could use in every plugin to take care of the mundane creation of a plugin options page: so add menu page, white list settings, spit out and validate options, etc.  I thought basically, I wanted to re-use something I must need to write a class.  </p>

<p>at its most base, i was expecting that i could say new KIA_Plugin_Options($args) in both plugins one and two (with different $args) and that each would crank out the options pages for their respective plugins. however, i have added the following class in 2 plugins and instead of creating the menus for each it only handles 1 and then dies.  so parts of it work, but isn't the re-usable panacea I was going for yet, so i feel like i am missing some important concept in OOP.</p>

<p>I know I need to update the db to start managing the transaction log size to help prevent this problem in the future.  So, assuming I have enough free space, I:<br>
1. right click the db and choose Backup<br>
2. set 'Backup Type' to 'Transaction Log'<br>

6034417,hoverIntent drop down menu overlap issue,"<p>So the problem is the following:
i have a drop down menu that contains sub elements that collapse and expand(showing/hiding sub sub elements).
I'm using hoverIntent plugin for the drop downs but my problem is that for the ""onMouseOut"" function i want to add a delay(so in case, you expand/collapse the subitems your drop-down height changes and your mouse pointer ends outside the drop-down area, by having this delay you have 500 milliseconds to hover the mouse back on the sub menu so it's not suddently dissapearing). If i add this timeout, when moving the mouse over different tabs, the dropdowns overlap(dropdown 1 has 500 milliseconds until it dissapears and dropdown 2 it's just appearing because i'm hovering the mouse over tab 2.)</p>

<p>Any idea on how to solve this?</p>

<p>this is my jquery:</p>

<pre><code>    var config = {    
     sensitivity: 7, // number = sensitivity threshold (must be 1 or higher)    
     interval: 100,  // number = milliseconds for onMouseOver polling interval    
     over: doOpen,   // function = onMouseOver callback (REQUIRED)    
     timeout: 500,   // number = milliseconds delay before onMouseOut

6034424,Quantum proofs of classical theorems,"<p>I'm interested in examples of problems where a theorem which seemingly has nothing to do with quantum mechanics/information (e.g. states something about purely classical objects) can nevertheless be proved using quantum tools.

<p>Particularly interesting would be examples where a quantum proof is not only possible, but also ""more illuminating"", in analogy with real and complex analysis, where putting a real problem in the complex setting often makes it more natural (e.g. geometry is simpler since $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed etc.); in other words, classical problems for which quantum world is their ""natural habitat"".</p>

<p>Later on I went to all the desktops and both the CPU meter and the clock were spherical.</p>

<p>So do the netbook have this ""aspect ratio"" problem?  It is not a big deal but it'd be nice to know if I get a netbook and know that it is common on the netbook.  (and aware that the picture and photos will be slightly distorted).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>All the netbooks were at 1024 x 600, which was their ""native"" resolution.  <strong><em>Every single one of the netbooks showed an oval shaped clock.</em></strong>  None of the desktop had that issue.</p>

<p>Let $f,g \colon \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ be two holomorphic functions s.t. 
$$
\vert f(z) \vert \le \vert g(z) \vert, \qquad \forall z \in \mathbb C. 
$$</p>

<p>Is it true that there exists $c \in \mathbb C$ s.t. $f(z)=cg(z)$ for every $z \in \mathbb C$? </p>

<p>My answer is yes: in fact, if $g(z) \ne 0$ then I can divide and I obtain
$$
\left \vert \frac{f(z)}{g(z)} \right \vert \le 1
$$
from which I can conclude that $\frac{f}{g} \equiv c \Leftrightarrow f\equiv c g $, for some $c \in\mathbb C$, by Liouville's theorem.</p>

<p>The equality $f\equiv c g$ still holds for $z$ s.t. $g(z)=0$: from $\vert f(z) \vert \le \vert g(z) \vert$ and $g(z)=0$ I deduce $f(z)=0$. To sum up, we have $f\equiv c g$ for every $z \in \mathbb C$. </p>

<p>What potential reasons would you have for not using JRuby?</p>

<p>Ones that have been mentioned by others are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Performance for short programs. JRuby is described as faster for longer programs, but having a longer initialization time. Workarounds are discussed <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224178/how-to-improve-jruby-load-time"">in this question</a>.</li>
<li>C extensions: JRuby supports some, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3927615/is-there-an-advantage-to-running-jruby-if-you-dont-know-any-java/3928025#3928025"">but not all</a>, C extensions that are used with MRI/YARV.</li>
<li>Concurrency as a two-edged sword. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3927615/is-there-an-advantage-to-running-jruby-if-you-dont-know-any-java/3928025#3928025"">There's non-thread-safe code out there</a> that people haven't discovered because the most popular implementation doesn't have true concurrency.</li>
<li>JRuby <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3927615/is-there-an-advantage-to-running-jruby-if-you-dont-know-any-java/3927834#3927834"">can use more memory</a>.</li>
<li>JRuby has <a href=""http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/DifferencesBetweenMriAndJruby"" rel=""nofollow"">decided not to do</a> certain things CRuby does. This includes continuations (which I think are deprecated in CRuby anyway), and fork. They also have a different native endian, and time precision.</li>
<li>JRuby <a href=""http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/PerformanceTuning"" rel=""nofollow"">doesn't enable ObjectSpace</a> by default.</li>
</ol>

<p>Potential reasons I have include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Libraries you use may not be designed to run under JRuby. For example, BioRuby, which has 127 watchers and 60 forks on GitHub, had a <a href=""http://github.com/bioruby/bioruby/issues/issue/6"" rel=""nofollow"">minor incompatibility</a> with JRuby.</li>
<li>Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt about using a less popular implementation. I know JRuby passes RubySpec better than CRuby, but RubySpec is not yet complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there any other reasons you wouldn't use JRuby?</p>

6034460,What is wrong with the Unlicense?,"<p>I have often heard that I should not use the <a href=""http://unlicense.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Unlicense</a> because of issues regarding putting things into the public domain. However, I do not understand why this would be an issue for the Unlicense. The Unlicense attempts to put whatever is being unlicensed into the public domain, and if that works, awesome! However, the author of the Unlicense understands that putting something into the public domain is not so simple, it may even be impossible, and therefore the Unlicense contains a backup clause (the 2nd paragraph) which clearly states that everyone is free to do whatever they want with the Unlicensed software. The Unlicense even includes a disclaimer containing the usual ""this software is provided as-is blah blah"" legalese.</p>

<p>Is the Unlicense bad because it is short and doesn't define who the ""unlicensor"", the ""unlicensee"" and Santa Claus is? If yes, then what about the MIT/BSD-style licenses? They are generally considered to be valid, so why isn't the Unlicense? Is the opposition to public domain waivers with permissive license backup clauses, such as the Unlicense, and even the Creative Commons CC0, just FUD or are there really major legal issues with them?</p>

<p>For the lazy people, here is the full text of the Unlicense:</p>

        mapView = (MapView) findViewById(R.id.mapView)

<p>It uses facebook connect and my idea after the successful connection to start a new activity showing the map - how should be done this?</p>

<p>When you run the ShowTheMap as a stand-alone project it runs perfect without any error.</p>

6034469,How to search for a person's name in a text? (heuristic),"<p>I have a <em>huge list</em> of person's full names that I must search in a <em>huge text</em>.</p>

<p>Only <em>part of the name</em> may appear in the text. And it is possible to be <em>misspelled</em>, <em>misstyped</em> or <em>abreviated</em>. The text has no tokens, so I don't know where a person name starts in the text. And I don't if know if the name <em>will appear or not</em> in the text.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>I have <strong>""Barack Hussein Obama""</strong> in my list, so I have to check for occurrences of that name in the following texts:</p>

<ul>
<li>...The candidate <strong>Barack Obama</strong> was elected the president of the United States... (incomplete)</li>
<li>...The candidate <strong>Barack Hussein</strong> was elected the president of the United States... (incomplete)</li>
<li>...The candidate <strong>Barack H. O.</strong> was elected the president of the United States... (abbreviated)</li>
<li>...The candidate <strong>Barack ObaNa</strong> was elected the president of the United States... (misspelled)</li>
<li>...The candidate <strong>Barack OVama</strong> was elected the president of the United States... (misstyped, B is next to V)</li>
<li>...The candidate <strong>John McCain</strong> lost the the election... (no occurrences of Obama name)</li>

I ask because they take up considerable space and they're a significant time sink in my design workflow. Nowadays in late 2012, the only supported non-retina devices are steadily dying out. According to my stats: 13.8% of my users were on iPhone 3GS or older (including older iPhones and iPod Touches 3rd gen and below) during the month of September.</p>

<p>I'm not asking whether it's a good idea or not (sometimes it's good to create less detailed artwork for lower res devices). I just want to know whether only including @2x assets will work reliably on non-Retina displays and whether there's any implications?</p>

6034485,Tools for laptop software provisioning?,"<p>At our company, we receive a laptop that is mostly pre-configured for a new employee using their own software provisioning tool.  However, with our development teams, there tends to be a number of additional tools and settings that we need to set up on a computer before the employee can be ""ready to go"".  This differs on a team-by-team basis, so a common solution for all development teams is to get the computer and manually install/setup the missing pieces for that laptop.</p>

<p>Are there any personal software provisioning systems for Windows-based computers that would allow our team to be able to keep our own software up-to-date across our team?  </p>

<p>I was thinking something that wouldn't be limited to new computer setups, but would allow a team to apply patch updates that would let them get the latest version of their dev environment set up so that the team can make assumptions about ""it works on my system"" meaning ""it works on our common dev environment"".</p>

6034488,DNAT to 127.0.0.1 with iptables / Destination access control for transparent SOCKS proxy,"<p>I have a server running on my local network that acts as a router for the computers in my network. I want to achieve now that outgoing TCP requests to certain IP addresses are tunnelled through an SSH connection, without giving the people from my network the possibility to use that SSH tunnel to connect to arbitrary hosts.</p>

<p>The approach I had in mind until now was to have an instance of <a href=""http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/"" rel=""nofollow"">redsocks</a> listening on localhost and to redirect all outgoing requests to the IP addresses I want to divert to that redsocks instance. I added the following iptables rule:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d 1.2.3.4 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:12345
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently, the Linux kernel considers packets coming from a non-127.0.0.0/8 address to an 127.0.0.0/8 address as “Martian packets” and drops them. What worked, though, was to have redsocks listen on eth0 instead of lo and then have iptables DNAT the packets to the eth0 address instead (or using a REDIRECT rule). The problem about this is that then every computer on my network can use the redsocks instance to connect to every host on the internet, but I want to limit its usage to a certain set of IP addresses only.</p>

<p>Is there any way to make iptables DNAT packets to 127.0.0.1? Otherwise, does anyone have an idea how I could achieve my goal without opening up the tunnel to everyone?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have also tried to change the source of the packets, without any success:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 1.2.3.4 -j SNAT --to-source 127.0.0.1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 127.0.0.1 -j SNAT --to-source 127.0.0.1

6034490,Is there a shortcut to binary-serialize every property in an object?,"<p>If there is an object in which <strong>every public property must be serialized</strong> and properties are simple (just numbers or strings or objects already implementing <code>ISerializable</code>), is there an easy way to do it without having to create <code>GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)</code> and a constructor taking <code>SerializationInfo</code> as argument every time?</p>

<p>I know that it can be done manually with reflection, but is there a magic method inside the .NET Framework to do it?</p>

<p>So the correct answer is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't try to implement ISerializable - it is for custom serialization. Instead add the [Serializable] attribute right before your class declaration.</p>

6034501,Android terminology and how to set panel's beckground image,"<p>I am new to Android. So new that I am not even clear on the terminology. From the user perspective, one can swipe from one page (iOS term) to another on Android. I have been told that these are called ""panels"" - but googling that term, I find out about the notification panel - which seems to be what iOS would call the status bar. Or, perhaps, these are called ""home screens""</p>

<p>I would like to find out if there is a way to change the background image as the user swipe from one page/panel(?) to another. For example, I might want my game apps to have a green background and my social media apps to have a blue background. If this can be done by setting a panel's background image, that would be good. If there's a hack with wallpapers, that would be okay, too.</p>

<p>Any pointers to Android UI guideline doc that names visual entities would be great. Likewise, any pointers to a glossary of Android UI terms would also be wonderful.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 
I have just come across ""live wallpaper"" and am wondering if this - with onOffsetsChanged() - is the way to go.</p>

The given error links to <a href=""http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change</a> which talks about using a 1.4.4 subversion client on a subversion 1.5 formated checkout.</p>

<p>Ankhsvn's <a href=""http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=3794"" rel=""nofollow"">home page</a> says that Ankhsvn 2.0 and above uses subversion 1.5 internally. The link doesn't mention anything about 1.5 clients having issues.</p>

<p>My own limited troubleshooting hasn't turned up anything I can directly point to but I do have TortoiseSVN 1.6.1 installed which uses Subversion 1.6.1 internally. I have a habit of using TortoiseSVN to commit stuff in my project folder which would bypass anything Ankhsvn is doing. Would this be causing a similar problem that trying to use 1.4.4 and 1.5 clients would cause or is something else happening?</p>

6034508,Magento: Static blocks and configuration settings migration,"<p>To migrate all changes to all environments I use database upgrade scripts. I use them to create different instances(customer, tax settings etc.) but usually to migrate static blocks and config settings. </p>

<p>To migrate static blocks:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$block = Mage::getModel('cms/block');
$data = array(
   'title' =&gt; 'Block title',
   'identifier' =&gt; 'block_identifier',
   'content' =&gt; 'block content',
   'is_active' =&gt; 1,
   'stores' =&gt; array(0 =&gt; Mage_Core_Model_App::ADMIN_STORE_ID),
);

$block-&gt;addData($data);
$block-&gt;save();
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To migrate settings:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
Mage::getModel('core/config')-&gt;saveConfig('design/theme/default', 'theme');
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know that we can modify Magento settings via config.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;default&gt;
    &lt;general&gt;
        &lt;store_information&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;My Store&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;/store_information&gt;
        &lt;content_staging&gt;
            &lt;block_frontend_stub&gt;home&lt;/block_frontend_stub&gt;
        &lt;/content_staging&gt;
    &lt;/general&gt;
&lt;/default&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But as far as I understand we can modify settings in such way only if paths: <strong>general/store_information/name</strong>
and<br>
<strong>general/content_staging/block_frontend_stub</strong>
don't exists at db or their values equal NULL, if value not NULL we can't modify it via xml. I tested it on my local environment and I think I'm right but can't find a code at Magento which is responsible for setting configuration via xml. 
Am I right?</p>

<p>Can you show me the part of code which is responsible for it?
And what is your best migration practices for Magento? Maybe I don't know something :)</p>

6034515,Visualising html5 audio,"<p>I'm really interested in creating some sort of equaliser/visualiser to represent audio from my <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag. So far I've been able to find several very fancy experiments that visualise audio. Most of them based on webgl, and only working in chrome. What I wan't to achieve is much more simpler than that, it's just a basic, one colour, 2d visualiser, nothing fancy.</p>

<p>This is something very similar to what I wan't to achieve (some sort of image in the middle and visualisation along the sides, very basic, yet I like it ;) )<br> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLRyAz0WFnw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLRyAz0WFnw</a> <br></p>

<p>The way I want it to work is to render/create visualisation based on src of audio tag, so for example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;audio id=""test"" 
src=""http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/78404260/stream?client_id=7a17129ba9cd5fff34f847e3539829b7""&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;!-- Some example from sound cloud --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and there would be a canvas tag on the page which takes src from audio tag with certain id, in this case ""test"". I don't think something this simple should require usage of WebGl, and would like to instead use plain canvas, so it works in most browsers with html5 support. I'm a javascript newbie, so I don't know where to start. I mentioned several examples I found before, but looking at their source didn't help at all. I'm looking for elegant solution with nothing complex going on. I understand that stackoverflow is not for asking for complete code, so if you could just get me started, e.g. explain how to interact with audio, change size of those ""equaliser sticks"" depending on what is playing etc.. would be great ;)) (jQuery suggestions are also welcome)</p>

6034518,C# Partial Class and COM Interface,"<p>I'm creating a C# library and am going to expose a COM interface to it.</p>

<p>I understand the steps requried to do this, i.e. </p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure assumbly GUID is assigned, e.g:
<code>[assembly: Guid(""dde7717b-2b75-4972-a4eb-b3d040c0a182"")]</code></li>
<li>Ensure COMVibile attribute is True</li>
<li>Put a GUID attribute on the class, e.g. <code>[GuidAttribute(""4df74b15-d531-4217-af7e-56972e393904"")]</code></li>
<li>Register using Regasm.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is this. If I have a partial class defined. Do I need to add the <code>GuidAttribute</code> to both these classes? </p>

<p>In fact, thinking about this, I'm guessing this question applies whatever the attribute (e.g. <code>Serializable</code>).</p>

6034519,Tips for optimising Database and POST request performance,"<p>I am developing an application which involves multiple user interactivity in real time. It basically involves lots of AJAX POST/GET requests from each user to the server - which in turn translates to database reads and writes. The real time result returned from the server is used to update the client side front end.</p>

<p>I know optimisation is quite a tricky, specialised area, but what advice would you give me to get maximum speed of operation here - speed is of paramount importance, but currently some of these POST requests take 20-30 seconds to return.</p>

<p>One way I have thought about optimising it is to club POST requests and send them out to the server as a group 8-10, instead of firing individual requests. I am not currently using caching in the database side, and don't really have too much knowledge on what it is, and whether it will be beneficial in this case.</p>

<p>Also, do the AJAX POST and GET requests incur the same overhead in terms of speed?</p>

6034521,Database choices,"<p>I have a prickly design issue regarding the choice of database technologies to use for a group of new applications. The final suite of applications would have the following database requirements...</p>

<p>Central databases (more than one database) using mysql (must be mysql due to justhost.com).</p>

<p>An application to be written which accesses the multiple mysql databases on the web host. This application will also write to local serverless database (sqlite/firebird/vistadb/whatever).</p>

<p>Different flavors of this application will be created for windows (.NET), windows mobile, android if possible, iphone if possible.</p>

<p>So, the design task is to minimise the quantity of code to achieve this. This is going to be tricky since the languages used are already c# / java (android) and objc (iphone). Not too worried about that, but can the work required to implement the various database access layers be minimised? </p>

<p>The serverless database will hold similar data to the mysql server, so some kind of inheritance in the DAL would be useful.</p>

<p>Looking at hibernate/nhibernate and there is linq to whatever. So many choices!</p>

I'm not sure what the best approach is... what I would love (but do not know where to begin even searching for this solution) would be to open a popup balloon style window with a few textboxes and a submit button.</p>

We now find that our ASP.NET 1.1 web application can still invokde the C++ COM object, but the C++ COM object is unable to call CoCreateInstance() on the new .NET 2.0 COM object.

<pre><code>def user = com.playhardsports.football.web.admin.auth.User.find(""from User where username=?"", [UID])
def authorities = [new GrantedAuthorityImpl('ROLE_USER')] as GrantedAuthority[]

def authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, fakePassword, authorities)
SecurityContextHolder.context.authentication = authentication

<p>The problem I'm having now is that I don't know where to redirect the user after the authentication.</p>

<p>A common scenario is that the user visits a protected page and Acegi redirects them to the login form.  On my login form I also have the controls for Gigya to validate the user.  Of course, meanwhile, the normal Acegi flow would be after login to redirect back to the original protected page.</p>

6034563,Uniform White Noise,"<p>I found a contradiction I couldn't resolve by my self.
It's about a ""Uniform White Noise"".</p>

<p>$ \forall t \in  \mathbb{R}, \ {x}_{t} \sim U[-1, \  1] $
</p>

<p>If we chose to go by the PSD definition of ""White Noise"" (Constant all over the Frequencies) we get:  </p>

</p>

<p>Yet, Clearly:  </p>

<p>$ E[{x}_{t} {x}_{t +  \tau}] \underset{ \tau = 0}{=}E[{x}_{t} {x}_{t}]= \frac{1}{3} $

Please mind this is a Continuous Random Process. We don't have such problem in the Discrete case.</p>

Either there's no such ""White Noise"" (Why?) or There's a good explanation (Could someone derive it Mathematically) how to get the Delta in The Variance.</p>

<p>Currently I have a current_point vector which I iterate through to specify each index, and a max_points vector which specifies the size of the array. So, if for example I wanted a 3-dimensional array of size 1000 x 15 x 3, max_points = [1000 15 3], and current_point iterates from [1, 1, 1] to [1000, 15, 3] ([1, 1, 1] -> [1000, 1, 1] -> [1, 2, 1] -> [1000, 2, 1] ->...).

<p>output_matrix(current_point) = val</p>

<p>But apparently something like output_matrix([1 2 3]) = val will just set outputmatrix(1:3) = 30. I can't just use dummy variables because sometimes the matrix will need 3 indexes, other times 4, other times 2, etc, so a vector of variable length is really what I need here. Is there a simple way to use a vector as the points in an index?</p>

6034573,What is the most efficient way to read tile data (MBTiles) from SQLite table by using AnyDAC (FireDAC)?,"<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>I'm working on a SQLite tile cache database (similar to <a href=""http://mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>MBTiles</code></a> specification), consisting for now just from a single table <code>Tiles</code> with the following columns:</p>

<p><code>X [INTEGER]</code> - horizontal tile index (not map coordinate)<br>
<code>Y [INTEGER]</code> - vertical tile index (not map coordinate)<br>
<code>Z [INTEGER]</code> - zoom level of a tile<br>
<code>Data [BLOB]</code> - stream with a tile image data (currently PNG images)</p>

<p>All the coords to tile calculations are done in the application, so the <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>SQLite R*Tree Module</code></a> with the corresponding <a href=""http://docs.embarcadero.com/products/rad_studio/firedac/frames.html?frmname=topic&amp;frmfile=uADPhysSQLite_TADSQLiteRTree.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>TADSQLiteRTree</code></a> class have no meaning for me. All I need is to load <code>Data</code> field blob stream of a record found by a given <code>X, Y, Z</code> values as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The application will, except this database, have also a memory cache implemented by a hash table like this <code>TTileCache</code> type:</p>

<pre><code>type
  TTileIdent = record
    X: Integer;
    Y: Integer;
    Z: Integer;
  end;    
  TTileData = TMemoryStream;    
  TTileCache = TDictionary&lt;TTileIdent, TTileData&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow when asking for a certain tile while having <code>X, Y, Z</code> values calculated will be simple. I will ask for a tile the memory cache (partially filled from the above table at app. startup), and if the tile won't be found there, ask the database (and even if there won't the tile be found, download it from tile server).</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>Which AnyDAC (FireDAC) component(s) would you use for frequent querying of 3 integer column values in a SQLite table (with, let's say 100k records) with an optional loading of the found blob stream ?</p>

<p>Would you use:</p>

<ul>
<li>query type component (I'd say executing of the same prepared query might be efficient, isn't it ?)</li>
<li>memory table (I'm afraid of it's size, since there might be several GB stored in the tiles table, or is it somehow streamed for instance ?)</li>
<li>something different ?</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>

<p>The problem comes in when:  The user enters something into txtWeight, clicks the submit to get both ddlDevice &amp; txtHeight to highlight because they are required, then...  The user clicks on either cbDeclined &amp; cbIsOOfFac.  The highlight is NOT going away.  I am trying to figure out how to get the highlighting around the height and drop down to go away.</p>

<p>I tried to create a fully working jsFiddler, but I cannot get anything to work, though everything looks correct.  here is the link (I cannot post links, so I expanded it a bit)</p>

<p>jsfiddle dot net/scarleton/9hDZQ/12/</p>

<p>If you remove the last /12/, you will see my first version that is a cut/paste from the real thing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Per a suggestion I tried adding $('form').valid(); a number of places. </p>

<p>When I added it to the end of the UpdateTextBoxes() function, they started out highlighted, not what I want.</p>

<p>When I added it after the click() event of either of the radio button, the text would go away, but the actual controls stayed highlighted.  It looks like the function on the required property of the rule is not fully working, maybe.  What is really interesting is this:  When I enter a height, click , then weight and device are highlighted and have the error message under them.  When I click on one of the radio buttons, the text goes away, but the highlight does not.  But...  The height is NOT highlighted, it stays normal.</p>

6034578,How to specify and make use of header files for verilog language while using exuberant ctags with emacs,"<p>I have recently started using exuberant ctags and emacs for verilog &amp; system verilog coding and code browsing. I currently generate the tags using the command</p>

<pre><code>ctags -e -R --tag-relative=yes --langmap=verilog:.v.vh.sv.svh 
</code></pre>

<p>My code contains a lot of `define macros which are all specified in certain header files with extension "".vh"" &amp; "".svh"". For e.g. a header file named <strong>foo.vh</strong> has the following code</p>

<pre><code>`define WIDTH_ADDRESS 32;
</code></pre>

<p>and a file <strong>top.v</strong> invokes the macro as follows</p>

<pre><code>input [`WIDTH_ADDRESS - 1 : 0] InAddress;
</code></pre>

<p>While browsing the <strong>top.v</strong> file using emacs, is there any way by which I can jump directly to to the macro definition in the <strong>foo.vh</strong> file?</p>

<p>I have been using <code>M-x tags-search &lt;RET&gt; WIDTH_ADDRESS &lt;RET&gt;</code> for sometime now but it jumps to quite a few other instances of `WIDTH_ADDRESS in other files before reaching the foo.vh file.</p>

<p>After some research I did see an option to specify header files using <code>-h</code> option with ctags during tags generation. However I could not get it to work and I guess there was some syntactical error from my part.</p>

<p>First of all are there any notable benefits of specifying a header file using <code>-h</code> option? If so, what is the correct syntax to specify header files? Also can I specify emacs to look into these header files first (files with extension "".vh"" &amp;"".svh"")  before parsing other files (with extension "".v"" &amp; "".sv"")</p>

79
112
1
1

<p>If I define the array in the action itself (not doing it globally outside the action), I get the expected results i.e. <code>ch[0][0]</code> shows Option 1 and <code>ch[0][1]</code> shows Option 2. Eventually, I want to have access to the array in my view. There may be a better way to do this.</p>

6034581,HTML and Compilers,"<p>This question is a more discussion oriented one that a simple problem specific question. 
Writing basic HTML is simple but writing fast light standards based, SEO best practices complaint, all browsers compatible HTML pages is hard and very time consuming. </p>

<p>But why it hard ? </p>

<p>In my opinion it hard because of the hundreds of different rules what need to be followed, rules what are hard to remember and even if you remember it hard to merge them together in not contradicting form and the only way to validate you work is by loading it in every browsers you support and validating every scenario.</p>

<p>But it really looks like a problem we had in the past in other areas of programming, previously before inventions of high level languages writing program in assembly is looks a lot like writing HTML files, you was forced to remember hundred of different rules for performance, correctness security and so on and the only way to validate them was by executing the program. </p>

<p>In other fields this problem was solved by compilers of high level languages what make a syntax simpler, make performance optimizations, check program syntactic correction before execution. </p>

<p>Don’t you think we need a different simpler language for writing web pages and compiler what could produce browser specific, standard complaint size optimized HTML from this language ?</p>

<p>Do you think it possible to create such languge and compiler ?</p>

6034598,Faye & Ruby or Node.js for scalability,"<p>I'm looking to prototype a web app that will use sockets to push a gentle stream of messages to mobile web app clients. I want to pick an architecture that will work for a large number of clients if/when it moves to production (so i dont have to change later)</p>

<p>I'd like to start with rails because its familiar and has a strong structure from the go meaning easier to prototype. I think Faye will provide what i need in terms of a pub-sub layer but am I going to create a bottleneck by using ruby and the high number of socket connections,  or will Faye isolate/protect Ruby server from that load, if you follow?</p>

<p>At the outset the load will not be significant so it won't matter, i just don't want to be hobbled later on when there are a lot of socket connections and i wish i used node.js ! Server side JS would be fairly new to me but I guess there are benefits in that the JS app can include the client side also </p>

"
6034607,Freezing Previous Years Data,"<p>I have a database that tracks employee’s data for the current year and previous years.
In examples below I will use calendar years (years start in Jan and end in Dec)- this is not always the case, some users have their year running from July to June- or April to March, etc.</p>

<p>There are many tables that, with a few heavy calculations, make a view of the employee’s data at this point in time.</p>

<p>This current year’s data is what users look at mostly. But data from previous years impact on this year (so, a change made to the 2008 data- will have a knock on effect on 2009, and then into 2010 and so onto this year).</p>

<p>Obviously, this has a negative impact on performance when viewing reports as viewing this year’s data will mean trudging through all the previous years- calculating and creating views until the end result is found. As the application ages, this problem will get worse and worse- say in 2015, anybody using the system from its inception (2008) will be waiting for a long time to get their data.</p>

<p>We plan to freeze previous years data so instead of having data from 2008, 2009, 2010 and this year’s data- we would have one block with the previous year’s data (with all calculations done for those previous years) and this year’s data.</p>

<p>In this way, we would have the end results data for all the previous year’s already calculated and we would only need to add to this year to get the final result.</p>

<p>Obviously, we would have to prevent users from entering/updating data in previous years.</p>

<p>My question is what is the best way to achieve this? I presume you would need some process that waits until the new year and does some calculations.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

I thought this is because of the DNS servers used, so I tried it on a windows box with the same DNS servers, but I get 404 as expected on it.</p>

<p>How can I get rid of search.com on CentOS?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Finally...
The problem was because of the missing <code>search</code> option in the resolv.conf file. Yes, faker suggested to add it, but the problem was that I restarted the network service after adding it and the DHCP client overwritten the resolv.conf file.
I think the <code>search</code> option is written in resov.conf file by default even if using dhcp client, but, apparently because of having multiple ethernet controllers and each controller having it's own dhcp client configuration it didn't add the 'search' option to resolv.conf.</p>

<p>I reconfigured now the dhcp client configuration to add <code>search</code> to resolv.conf and the domain resolving works as expected.</p>

<p>Specifically I was thinking of a start on load and lasting 10 seconds with the javascript executing at intervals of 100 milliseconds. What's supposed to happen is the background-color or element A will change using a gradient range (start #000 and end #fff) while the opacity of element B will change (start 0 and end 1). So every 100 milliseconds the opacity will increase by 1 (0.01, 0.02, ..., 1.0) and end. All the while element A's background will step along the gradient from #000 to #fff.</p>

<p>I can see by the jQuery Glow that this functionality shouldn't be too difficult, but piecing it together isn't proving that intuitive. That js looks pretty geared towards hovering and links, not defining different values onLoad and ending at a predetermined time.</p>

<p>How could I do this? Thanks.</p>

6034623,Using Fabric to search for and run a file,"<p>I'm working on a website using Django and I have Fabric as well, which is very useful for scripting some chunks of code that me and other developers use. I'm pretty new to all of these (and linux in general, tbh) so I have ideas, but I don't know how (or if) they are possible. Specifically, I wanted to write a script to start the server on a specific port that we use for testing. Manually, I would just run</p>

<pre><code>python ~/project/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080

    local(""python ~/project/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080"")
</code></pre>

<p>which works, but I'm not the only one using the port for testing, and ~/project/ is not the only project which would need to use a similar script. Is there a way to search down the tree from the directory you are working in for the first manage.py and then to run it the same command from there?</p>

<ul>
<li>Screen remains totally black. Absolutely nothing comes up. I need to retry booting. (Happens 70% of the time). </li>
<li>Laptop starts regular boot. However, somewhere during the boot process it goes black and I need to retry (20% of the time). Screen turning black is more likely when I move the laptop around during boot. </li>
<li>Laptop boots properly. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once booted, all is fine. But I'm afraid to turn it off and have been keeping the laptop running till the night. Additional details:</p>

<ul>
<li>All normal lights light up when I boot; whichever of the scenarios goes down. </li>
<li>There are no odd sounds or beeps, whichever of the scenarios goes down. </li>
<li>I thought it might be the SSD drive that is dying, but it does not use SMART and <a href=""http://superuser.com/questions/482404/check-ssd-health-without-using-smart/482409"">it appears difficult to troubleshoot</a>. </li>

6034633,Dealing with nested calls to Console when converting from a console application to a web application,"<p>I have created a .dll for a console environment and need to migrate it to a web environment. The problem comes about when during the process of the program, communication needs to be made with an end user without loosing the position in the stack. I've created a small example to show our problem. </p>

<p>Consider the following Main program. It, with the nested Foo and FooB will basically keep asking users for text until the user gives a string 5 or more characters long. When the user gives such a string, all the failed attempts, if any will be shown.  In the web version, there will be two text boxes...the top will show what the program has written and what the user has responded; the bottom will be a place for the user to respond.</p>

<p>This example is simple can easily be converted to function which stores information between requests from the user. However, the real program which needs migration is much more complicated and is not ""re-writable."" In short, I'd like to leave Foo and FooB untouched as I migrate from a console application to a web application.</p>

<p>(the program should compile and run in VS 2010).</p>

6034635,Backtick and tilde keys - Why the switch?,"<p>Most of the differences between European and US keyboards make sense for reasons of localisation. However, one thing I've always felt the US keyboards did better (and all EU keyboards I've used seem to have this flaw), is having the ~ symbol on beside the number 1. EU keyboards instead have the ` key in that spot. For me to type a tilde, I have to press shift+# which is beside the enter key, an awkard combination for a symbol I use rather frequently.</p>

<p>Uses of ~:</p>

<ul>
<li>Approx</li>
<li>Home Directory on *x systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Uses of `:</p>

<ul>
<li>Executing shell commands in PHP</li>
<li>Escaping things on Stack Overflow and co.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tries timeout zero with same result - sometimes the image has been loaded and sometimes not so it works randomly, with larger images (taking longer time to load in browser) it of course fails more frequently. Right now I have bypassed it with a seconds timeout but that ain't no pretty solution :-/ perhaps I could put a loop on the find('img') that keeps checking for the image and only proceeds once found? But that might stick me in an infinite loop problem at some times?</p>

However since the space of all square integrable functions on the unit interval forms a Hilbert space, and all Hilbert Spaces are Banach, this space must not be of countable dimension.  However we know that each point has a unique decomposition as a sum complex exponentials $e^{2n\pi}$ were $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.  Thus these complex exponentials form a basis.  But since there is a countable number of such exponentials there must be a contradiction.  Where is that contradiction?</p>

I changed <code>#root :to =&gt; 'welcome#index'</code> to <code>root :to =&gt; 'welcome#index'</code>.</p>

<p>I also realized that I do not had a controller for the page <code>welcome/index</code> and i created it
with <code>rails g controller Welcome index</code>.</p>

I installed Apache 2.2 on Windows 7 to folder: ""C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2"".
Unfortunately, all folders in ""Program Files"" are for ""read only"". When I removes this flag from properties of some folder, it come back again.  </p>

<p>But my real problem is, that I can not to edit files in folder htdocs. When I editing them in Notepad++, I get following error: ""Pleas check whether if this file is oppened in another program"". So generaly, I succeed to delete files from htdocs folder, but after that I accept to get administrative control. I think, that if I will succeed to remove the ""read only"" flag complitely, the problem will solve.  </p>

<p>Normally I'm loggin in with non Administrator user (but in Administrators group).
With Administrator I succeed to edit the files, but also failed to remove ""read only"" flag.</p>

<p>I hope, that you will give me solution other that to work always with Administrator.</p>

6034665,Should I use an XML file or an API on a micro site?,"<p>Here is the scenario ... We have a custom CMS built by a 3rd party ...  We dont have direct access to the DB but the content can be exported to an XML file or accessed via API calls.</p>

<p>I need to build a micro site and I want to know which is better (overall) ... To build the site using the XML with all of the stories (less than 700Kb) and having to parse it when I need to display the news list (title, excerpt, date, byline) and then again when a user wants to see the complete story.... Or make individual calls via an API that gives me the story list in one call and the story in another call (via the story id).</p>

<p>Which is best? I see two things happening here. The XML file needs to be updated with a separate process when new content is added. That is automatically pulled with the API approach. However, using an XML has its benefits because I can use a caching system to serve the file from memory. I can also cache API calls to benefit from recurrent request to the API.</p>

If so is there a tutorial somewhere that's good for a beginner?</p>

<p>In case this matters my web application uses Spring and Hibernate.  I've been told by a colleague that perhaps these are causing the slow down in that they are so huge that somewhere a class loader is choking on the sheer number of classes it needs to load.</p>

<p>Proposition3.3. says that $1 \rightarrow Aut(E) \xrightarrow{j} G(E) \xrightarrow{p} T \rightarrow 1 $ is a short exact sequence of algebraic groups over an algebraically closed field $k$, where T is a torus over $k$ and $E$ is a vector bundle of a almost homogeneous variety $X$. I have no question about exactness, but the author says that since both $Aut(E) $ and $T$ are linear algebraic groups, $G(E)$ is a linear algebraic group.</p>

<p><strong>Question1.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is that means that if $1 \rightarrow G \xrightarrow{f} H \xrightarrow{g} K \rightarrow 1 $ is a short exact sequence of algebraic groups, then $H$ is linear if, and only if $G$ and $K$ are linear? Is that easy to see?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the proof of Proposition3.3., the author says that a surjective algebraic group homomorphism from a torus to a torus always has a section (see Borel [1]).</p>

<p><strong>Question2.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I already found this reference :A. Borel, ""Linear algebraic groups"", Benjamin (1969) MR0251042 Zbl 0206.49801 Zbl 0186.33201. But I can't find where prove this fact. Who can tell me where is the proof?</p>

<p>But after that change, reading the new file is taking about 4-5 seconds per record !!! So, my overall process would take a lot of DAYS to complete!
I've tried converting the accdb file to an old mdb file and after that reading again with the previous connection string, but the problem remains. I think is a problem with the database itself but I don't know what to do, in internet i didn't found any information with this kind of problem.</p>

6034690,Only allow certain outbound traffic on certain interfaces,"<p>I have rather an odd issue. I have a server with two network interfaces <code>eth0</code> and <code>eth1</code>. Each are connected to a different network. Each network has a internet gateway. The server has various <em>outbound</em> connections: http (some scripts on the server scrape websites), nfs client, samba client, dns client and an email fetcher to name but a few.</p>

<p>For reasons I won't go into, I need to split these outbound clients up so outbound http, nfs, samba and dns traffic is only requested over <code>eth0</code> while everything else goes off through <code>eth1</code>.</p>

<p>I've read around a few Google searches and it looks like <code>iptables</code> is what I'll need but I really haven't got a clue. I'm only used to managing inbound firewall rules through <code>ufw</code>.</p>

<p>Could somebody start me off with a few example rules and tell me how to get the system to adopt these rules on boot? Ideally without locking me out of my SSH connection (I <em>can</em> get physical access, but I'd rather not).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I can split the clients over two users if it's possible to limit all outbound traffic from an account to one interface. on paper that seems like it might be easier.</p>

6034694,Unable to load reference library - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process,"<p>I have a class library which I maintain in it's own project/solution. It contains a few basic functions I've written, that I use in some older VB.NET applications mainly.</p>

<p>I'm doing some work on one such application, and it has required changes to the Library assembly as well as the main application. However, I'm finding that when I change and compile the library, when I come to re-compile the main application I get an error:</p>

<pre><code>Error 8 Unable to load referenced library 'myLibrary.dll': The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
</code></pre>

<p>I've specified the 'myLibrary\bin\Release\myLibrary.dll' as the reference in the main project. I know in the past that I had the library project in the same solution, thus I could specify the project as a reference, rather than the release DLL, but I'd prefer to keep the projects separate.</p>

<p>Re-specifying the reference or reloading the main project solves the problem (temporarily at least), but I'd rather find a more sophisticated solution.</p>

6034705,How to track different performance improvements in different components of an application that might overlap?,"<p>So this is kind of a general question.Here is the problem:</p>

<p>I am currently working on a project along with 5 other people. We have all been assigned different performance tuning projects within an application (Java EE). However we all need to report how much of an improvement did we really achieve compared to our original component. Now if we are all checking in our code at various times, how do we necessarily track our own individual performance improvements in a given time? </p>

<p>I was thinking perhaps put flags in our code and keep track of all my code changes, but I feel like that would be too messy since  for example let's say an improvement would be like to utilize primitive data types instead of like Integer Objects, but this improvement might cross over to someone else's work. </p>

<p><em>Goal: I am attempting to install the Simics Tools for Eclipse plugin on Windows 7 64-bit.</em> </p>

<p>I am using Eclipse Indigo for Java (64-bit &lt;-- This will be a problem later) and have just installed the C/C++ IDE plugin, GEF draw2d plugin, and the Simics Tools for Eclipse. Once the installation of these plugins successfully finished, I restarted Eclipse and proceeded to launch Simics Control from inside Eclipse. An error dialog stated that this plugin could not run on 64 bit Eclipse.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, I decided to install a 32-bit version of Eclipse next to my current setup and to uninstall the plugins I had just installed (C/C++, GEF, and Simics) from Eclipse. First, I was going to remove the plugins to avoid wasting space. I went to <strong>Help->About->Installation Details</strong> and selected the installed plugins to uninstall. Removing the plugins appeared to be successful until I restarted Eclipse. </p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>After the removal of the plugins, when Eclipse launches, the splash screen appears without a progress bar along the bottom to show what is currently being loaded. After a few seconds, the splash screen disappears and an error dialog shows up: <em>An error has occurred. See the log file C:\Program Files (x86)\eclipse\configuration\1322503657546.log</em></p>

<p>I've read in the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/MDImporters/MDImporters.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Spotlight Importer Programming Guide"">Spotlight Importer Programming Guide</a> that one can create a Spotlight importer only on a <strong>per-document basis</strong>, that is if your application <em>Foobar</em> opens/creates files with extension <code>.foo</code>, you can then write a Spotlight importer for indexing properties of those files.</p>

<p>What I need, however, is for the Spotlight to somehow <strong>query some sort of a database</strong> with its own query (exactly what it now does with Dictionary).</p>

6034755,Can NHibernate detect when another program has written new data to a shared SQLite database?,"<p>I have two C# programs that share a single SQLite database file.  </p>

<p>One program (let's call it Writer) writes new data to the database.  The other program (Reader) reads it.  Both programs use Fluent NHibernate and System.Data.SQLite to access the DB.</p>

<p>Currently, I've just got a big Refresh button on my Reader program, and the user has to click it to get any new data that was written to the DB since the last refresh.  This works, but is hardly elegant.</p>

<p>Is there any way to get NHibernate to fire an event in the Reader program when the DB is updated by Writer, so I can automatically present new data to the user?   (I looked at the NH docs for Interceptors and Events, but it was not clear if these would do what I want)</p>

<p>Or, is there a good way to poll for updates using NH?</p>

6034772,How can I change Document library permissions for all site collections using powershell?,"<p>Total Powershell newbie here, but I have managed to write a couple scripts so far that have been working.</p>

<p>We are using 2010 Enterprise edition, and I have been tasked with creating a script that will add a new Document Library to every site collection....No problem, got that one created.  But the kicker on this was that they want the document library to be hidden from all users except for Site Collection Administrators.   </p>

<p>I have searched for 2 days straight (Google isnt returning any blue links anymore, just purple haha) and have not been able to find the answer.</p>

<p>Could anybody help me out with this?  What do I add to this script to make the new Libraries hidden from everyone except site collection admins?</p>

<p>this is what I have to create the libraries:</p>

<pre><code>$sites = get-spsite -webapplication http://portal -limit all
foreach($site in $sites)
{
$spWeb = Get-SPWeb $site.url
$listTemplate = [Microsoft.sharepoint.SPListTemplateType]::DocumentLibrary
$spWeb.Lists.Add(""Audits"",""Location for storage of Audit Files"",$listTemplate)
}

6034773,IE stops rendering HTML if one of the characters it tries to render is null (0x00),"<p>Been having some rendering issues with IE 7 and 9 (haven't tested 8, but it probs works the same)</p>

<p>So... I have the text: 
�fe217"";0d83427d421</p>

<p>or maybe that is some representation of it that SequelPro generates (MySQL workbench doesn't display it)</p>

<p>But, basically, it prevents the rest of the page from being rendered. everything is rendered until it hits this text. (again only in IE)</p>

<p>Now, in my rails app, the piece of code generating the text containing this string bomb, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> def category_form_filter(form, type, display_text) 
    form.collection_select(:category_id_equals, 
          current_account.categories.all, ""id"", ""name"", :label=&gt;false)
  end 
</code></pre>

<p>and then the other peice of code where IE breaks is generated with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;%= in_place_editor_field :category, :name, {}, {:external_control =&gt; ""edit_#{category.id.to_s}"", :cancelText =&gt; """"} %&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So... something that these two methods are doing works for non-IE browsers but doesn't with IE. Maybe IE needs extra escapage?</p>

<p>EDIT: when I pasted the text into stackoverflow, and hit subit my question, it said that the body of my question was empty. and then added a question diamond to teh front of the string. what is going on here?</p>

<p>EDIT2: I found a converter, that might help:<br>
Percent Encoding: %00fe217%22%3B0d83427d421<br>
Hex Code Points: 0000 0066 0065 0032 0031 0037 0022 003B 0030 0064 0038 0033 0034 0032 0037 0064 0034 0032 0031<br>
JS Escapes \0fe217\"";0d83427d421  </p>

<p>It seems that the first character is null (0000). and that could be what is breaking IE. =\</p>

<p>EDIT3: changed Title</p>

6034776,Issue processing PHP form checkboxes into MySQL table,"<p>I have a PHP form that uses checkboxes. I also have a MySQL database with 3 tables.</p>

<p>One of the tables is named TAGS and its columns are ID and ARTICLE_CONTENTS.</p>

<p>Another table in the database is called ARTICLES and its columns are ID, ARTICLETITLE, ARTICLEORGANIZATION, ARTICLEDATE, and ARTICLEURL.</p>

<p>The third table is called ARTICLES_TAGS and its columns are ARTICLE_ID and TAG_ID</p>

<p>The TAGS table has 87 entries that are similar to:</p>

<pre><code>1    |    geology
2    |    astronomy
3    |    chemistry
</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of the database is to create relationships between the TAGS and the ARTICLES. To do this, the PHP form uses checkboxes that the user can check when adding a new entry to the database. These checkboxes represent the tags in the TAGS table. So, for example, there would be a checkbox for each entry in the TAGS table: [ ]geology    [ ]astronomy    [ ]chemistry ...etc...</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is to insert information using text boxes (article title, article organization, article date, and article url) and to use mysql_insert_id() to get the ID of that insertion and to pair that ID with the ID of the tag associated with the checkboxes that are checked.</p>

<p>So, for instance, if the geology checkbox were to be checked and if, in the TAGS table the entry for geology were to be:</p>

<pre><code>02  |  geology
</code></pre>

<p>And, if the ID for the article being inserted happened to be 142</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>a new entry would be inserted into ARTICLES_TAGS:</p>

<pre><code>Article_ID    |    TAG_ID
   142        |      02
</code></pre>

<p>However, whenever I execute my form I get no entries in the ARTICLES_TAGS table though the information INSERTs into the ARTICLES table properly. I can not figure out where I've gone wrong.</p>

<p>I've been working on the wording of this question for a few days and I think it's clear now. Please let me know if there needs to be any clarification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> provides the eight standard global objects (cin,
  cout, etc). To do this correctly, this header also provides the
  contents of the <code>&lt;istream&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ostream&gt;</code> headers, but nothing else. The
  contents of this header look like</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ostream&gt;
#include &lt;istream&gt;

{
    extern istream cin;
    extern ostream cout;
    ....

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, the runtime penalty mentioned previously: the global objects must
  be initialized before any of your own code uses them; this is
  guaranteed by the standard. Like any other global object, they must be
  initialized once and only once. This is typically done with a
  construct like the one above, and the nested class ios_base::Init is
  specified in the standard for just this reason.</p>
  
  <p>How does it work? Because the header is included before any of your
  code, the __foo object is constructed before any of your objects.
  (Global objects are built in the order in which they are declared, and
  destroyed in reverse order.) The first time the constructor runs, the
  eight stream objects are set up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message clearly shows that the first three steps, for a C++ instance method void test(int a, int b, int c), are working correctly, extracting the parameters using Type and passing the results along - but I can't work out why the final invoke() is not being correctly used.</p>

<p>I've tried to fully specialize it, but then I get error messages about specialization outside of namespace scope (which I assume is because the method is a member of a templated class).</p>

<p>I've also tried shifting the incoming/outgoing parameter lists, so that the incoming is in the class variadic template, and the outgoing in the method to specialise the class for invocation instead - but I run into the ""sorry, unimplemented"" message about unpacking the variadic into the static  template.</p>

<p>I've also tried working around that by using a generic single variadic template, then specialising for the HEAD/TAIL case, and specialising for the empty set case, but then I get immediate ambiguity (probably because the HEAD/TAIL values are not actually passed as parameters - merely in the template).</p>

<p>But so far, no dice.  Anyone have any other ideas, or can explain where I'm going wrong?</p>

<p>Its close, but not 100% what i want. When you click the button for the 2nd time, I want the animation to play exactly in reverse, at the same slow speed... bringing the container back to the top, and hiding the top content.  Currently, the code im using is making the entire page disappear totally when the button is pressed the second time.  I do not want that.</p>

<p><em>-Bonus-</em></p>

<p>I also would like to, if at all possible, lock the header to the bottom of the page at a min-height when the button is first pressed to slide down.  The header would only be able to come up only so high when the window is shrunk, but if the window is fully expanded, the header is locked to the bottom of the page.  In a nutshell, You basically will see the header become the footer when the button is first pressed.</p>

<p>Not only that, I want to remove the ability to scroll the page down so that you can see the slid down container contents.  There should be no scroll bars once the container drops after pressing the slide down button.</p>

<p>I would like to externally load another page automatically into the topContent div once the container is slid down and the top content is fully revealed.</p>

6034811,Problems working with COM object in Open Office Basic,"<p>I am considering to switch from Excel to Open Office (actually to Lotus Symphony).<br>
I have many Excel files with VBA macros that connect to CAD, CAM and other applications, and to my own COM objects.<br>
The function <code>GetObject</code> doesn't exist in Open Office Basic, but I was able to make a function that uses the <code>GetObject</code> function of a scripting object. </p>

<p>The problem is that I can access some properties/methods of that object, but not others. </p>

<p>Below there is an example that connects to Excel, gets the <code>ExcelApp.Workbooks.Count</code> property, and crashes when it tries to get the <code>ExcelApp.Workbooks(I).Name</code> property. 
In this example I use Excel as the external application just because it's common and easy to understand. </p>

<p>I noticed that the Open Office VBA IDE is poorer than the Excel VBA IDE: it's impossible to change the value of a variable, evaluate an expression, change the current statement, no intellisense, etc.<br>
Is it so simple because it's Lotus Symphony, and installing another version of Open Office things would get better?<br>
Is it so simple because it's VBA, and using another language like Python things would get better? </p>

<p>Here is the code: </p>

6034814,jQuery: Pessimistic Record Locking when Browser/Computer goes into sleep mode?,"<p>I'm trying to debug an issue with some PHP/MySQL/jQuery code that handles pessimistic locking. It uses two fields: locking_user_id and locking_date_time. The locking is determined by an AJAX action to PHP/MySQL. The jQuery code below shows the typical update for the locking which occurs every 15 seconds. There's also a save action every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>My question is, what happens to the jQuery/Locking Update when someone's computer goes into ""sleep mode"" or is ""locked"" for a few hours? Will the AJAX call continue? I assume the setTimeout() no longer runs? One person is knowingly allowing edit views to remain open for hours at a time. I'm fairly certain this is causing the issue were seeing. I'm building in additional PHP validation checks on update, today.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions to make the Edit View ""timeout"" based on inactivity?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

// Automatically Save Every 10 Minutes
setInterval(submit_crudForm, 600000); // (1000 * 60 * 10 = 600000)

6034833,Sections and homomorphisms of modules,"<p>Here's a problem I already solved.</p>

<p>Prove that a homomorphism $r: M \rightarrow N$ of right A-modules admits a section $v: N \rightarrow M$ if and only if $r$ is surjective and $M = L \oplus \operatorname{ker}(r)$ where $L$ is a submodule of $M$. Call this (*)</p>

<p>Now here's the problem.</p>

<p>Suppose that the sequence $0 \rightarrow L \rightarrow M \rightarrow N \rightarrow 0$ of right $A$-modules is exact, where $u: L \rightarrow M$ and $r: M \rightarrow N$.</p>

<p>Prove that the homomorphism $u$ admits a retraction $p: M \rightarrow L$ if and only if $r$
admits a section $v: N \rightarrow M$.</p>

<p>My try:</p>

<p>=>) This is the one that bothers me. Do we really need to assume $u$ is a retraction? by exactness of the sequence we have that $r$ is surjective. So define a section $v: N \rightarrow M$ as follows: for each $n \in N$ pick $m \in M$ such that $r(m) = n$. Set $v(n) = m$ then $r \circ v = 1_{N}$, so that $r$ admits the section $v$.</p>

<p>&lt;=) Suppose $r: N \rightarrow M$ admits a section, then by (*) $M = \operatorname{ker}(r) \oplus \operatorname{Im}(v)$ and by exactness we have $M=\operatorname{Im}(u) \oplus \operatorname{Im}(v)$. Notice that by exactness we also have that $u$ is an injection. Define a retraction $p: M \rightarrow L$ as follows: given $m \in M$ write $m$ as $u(l)+v(n)$ where $l \in L$ and $n \in N$. Then set $p(m)=l$.</p>

<p>Since $M$ is a direct sum of $\operatorname{Im}(u)$ and $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ and $u$ is an injection we have that $p$ is well-defined and by construction $p \circ u = 1_{L}$ so that $p$ is a retraction of $u$.</p>

6034837,MySQL; LEFT OUTER joining on DATEDIFF with indexes taking 300+ seconds (but only the first time),"<p>MySQL's built in cache really makes this question moot for most of the day, but the very first time the following query is run, the performance is <em>terrible</em>: Taking over 300 seconds the first time whereas subsequent querying can complete in milliseconds. Running this with SQL_NO_CACHE then takes 2-4 seconds (!) which is very acceptable in this instance -- but the initial run-time is not.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DATEDIFF( bt.`datetime`, st.`datetime`) AS 'day_separation'
FROM `smallerTable` AS st
LEFT OUTER JOIN `bigTable` AS bt ON bt.item_id = st.item_id
  AND bt.code = 'X'
  AND bt.`datetime` &gt; st.`datetime`
  AND DATEDIFF ( bt.datetime, st.datetime) &lt; 11
  AND st.`datetime` &gt; '2012-07-01' AND st.`datetime` &lt; 'yesterdays-date 23:59:59'
</code></pre>

<p>I have introduced multi-column indexes (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13051246/in-mysql-how-to-build-index-to-speed-up-this-query"">thanks to this question</a>) but it still could not address this particular problem. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5442420/trying-to-optimize-mysql-query-with-left-outer-join"">This solution</a> looks inspired but I don't think it is applicable since I'm not sure how I could union these results.</p>

<p>The smaller table has ~8000 records and I want to count / include all of them right now. It will eventually grow bigger and contain items prior to 2012-07-01.</p>

<p>bigTable has 10 million records and I only want to match the ""pairing"" of those records to the smaller table. Part of the trouble is that they cannot share a direct key or reference linking them together so I am left with a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> and guessing that if the timestamp of the two events are &lt; 11 days apart (and share the other conditions) that they they must be related.</p>

<p>Excluding the test <code>DATEDIFF ( bt.datetime, st.datetime) &lt; 11</code> created 14k 'results' illustrating that the number of <code>DATEDIFF</code> calculations that ""<em>need</em> to occur"" is 14k-8k (a.k.a. 6k).</p>

<p><strong>INDEXES</strong>: the <code>datetime</code> fields of each table, the <code>code</code>, and the <code>item_id</code>s.</p>

<p>I have compound indexes on both tables in the order of <code>(item_id, datetime)</code>. From my understanding, that is the necessary order because we use the datetime fields in the select statement in the form of <code>DATEDIFF( bt.datetime, st.datetime)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Would a combined index on <code>(code, item_id, datetime)</code> revolutionize this query?</strong> (Yes it did!)</p>

<p>The explain reveals little to my untrained eye other than that it is using a temporary table which I understand can be time-consuming.</p>

<pre><code>id * select_type * table * type  * possible_keys * key                * key_len * ref           * rows * extra
1  * SIMPLE      * st    * index * NULL          * items_for_datetime * 59      * NULL          * 8295 * using index; using temporary; using filesort
1  * SIMPLE      * BT    * ref   * [many]        * items_for_datetime * 51      * master.st.item_id * 3    *
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on MySQL's whims, bigTable <em>sometimes</em> shows that it prefers the <code>item_id</code> key over <code>items_for_datetime</code>. Should I encourage the use of my joint index believing that I know better?</p>

<p>Some extra info: </p>

<ul>
<li>The inserts into these tables occur once each day (1~5k records into BT)</li>
<li>No updates or deletions ever occur</li>
<li>I could probably run two queries -- Change this one to INNER JOIN and then run a second one to subtract the number of results from the total records to find the number that didn't have a corresponding result in BT</li>
<li>We have already executed phpmyadmin's <code>Check Table</code>, <code>Defragmentation</code>, and <code>Optimize Table</code> on BT</li>
</ul>

<p>[aside] Could this be a good scenario for using a NoSQL database such as Mongo?</p>

<p>Why is there be such a disparity on the first run and the second? More importantly: <strong>What can be done to improve the timing of the first run?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> New attempts require a new day to find out their efficacy. Tomorrow I will attempt Barmar's suggestion using <code>BETWEEN</code> and <code>DATE_ADD</code>. I have also created a combined index on <code>(code, item_id, datetime)</code>. I will report back tomorrow the result but welcome any other ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Success! The first run of the query now only spent 6 seconds which is amazing considering where it came from. Subsequent querying took only .035 seconds! What a dream. The combined index on <code>(code, item_id, datetime)</code> no doubt had a hand in this success. Here is the new query: Thanks everyone!</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DATEDIFF( bt.`datetime`, st.`datetime` ) AS  'day_separation'
FROM  `smallerTable` AS st
LEFT OUTER JOIN bigTable AS bt USE INDEX (  `cmd_item_time` ) 
ON bt.item_id = st.item_id
  AND bt.code =  'X'
  AND bt.`datetime` BETWEEN st.`datetime` AND DATE_ADD( st.`datetime`, INTERVAL 10 DAY )

I have tried to do a timed sample of core motion data, using a NSTimer and calculate the difference between two samples, so I would have how much it rotated since the last sample, but from times to times it gives me crazy numbers like 13600 degrees even when the iPhone is resting on the table.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how this can be accomplished? </p>

6034845,Wave equation with variable speed coefficient,"<p>Consider the wave equation initial value problem in $\mathbb R^3$ with <em>spatially variable wave speed</em>, denoted by </p>

\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x,t)-c(x)\Delta u(x,t)&amp;=0\hspace{.2in}\text{in }\mathbb R^3\times(0,\infty),\\
u(x,0)&amp;=f(x),\\\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x,0)&amp;=g(x).

<p>My question: Is there a way to explicitly write down a solution similar to Kirchhoff's formula for the case of constant speed $c(x)=c_0$?</p>

<p>Intuitivly, i would expect the solution $u(x_0,t_0)$ for fixed space and time to be dependent on values of spherical integrals of $f$ and $g$ as in the constant speed case, but in a sound-speed dependent metric.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to do this mostly inside the XAML code declaritively (sp?). I'm using linq so the Company entity objects have a property named Division wich if I understand linq correctly should include Division objects of the divisions connected to the company.

6034872,Error when rolling out my software revision to terminal sessions instead of desktops?,"<p>I'm doing some maintenance on some software originally built by my predecessor at the company (who has since moved on to greener pastures). I'm currently rolling out a new version of the software.</p>

<p>At this company, the installation procedure is basically to just shove the /bin/Release directory out into our automated program updater's magic directory, allowing it to automatically copy the contents of that directory over to the local /Program Files/ and let the magic happen. The magic always seems to happen, so there's no big issue, there, although it does weird me out somewhat, after many years of .msi installers...</p>

<p>Anyway, rolling out the new software went fine on two of our file servers, but rolling it out into the third and final location went a bit differently.</p>

<p>The third section of the company doesn't use the auto-rollout software. They all use Windows' Remote Desktop Connection software to run software directly on the server.</p>

<p>So I go along to the server, check that the current version is working (which it is), back it up, etc. then copy the exact same software which works just fine on all of our other machines.</p>

<p>The new software now fails to play nice with the third-party libraries it's using (Crystal Reports and IBM Informix integration), even though those libraries are installed in the same location, and at the same version, on all of the PCs, the development machine included.</p>

I'm currently trying to recreate these components, because changing the target platform stops the DLLs from working.</p>

6034884,Common Lisp scoping (dynamic vs lexical),"<p>EDIT: I changed the example code after the first answer because I came up with a simple version that begs the same questions.</p>

<p>I am currently learning Common Lisp's scoping properties. After I thought I had a solid understanding I decided to code up some examples that I could predict the outcome of, but apparently I was wrong. I have three question, each one relating to an example below:</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre><code>(defmethod fun1 (x)
  (print x)
  (fun2))

(defmethod fun2 ()
  (print x))

(fun1 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre><code>5 
*** - EVAL: variable X has no value
</code></pre>

<p>Question: This makes sense. x is statically scoped and fun2 has no way of finding the value of x without having it passed explicitly.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre><code>(defvar x 100)

(defmethod fun1 (x)
  (print x)
  (fun2))

(defmethod fun2 ()
  (print x))

(fun1 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>5
5
</code></pre>

<p>Question: I don't understand why x is suddenly visible to fun2 with the value that fun1 gave it, instead of having a value of 100...</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<pre><code>(setf x 100)

(defmethod fun1 (x)
  (print x)
  (fun2))

(defmethod fun2 ()
  (print x))

(fun1 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>5
100
</code></pre>

<p>Question: Should I ignore these results since calling setf on an undeclared variable is apparently undefined? This happens to be what I would expect in my second example...</p>

<p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated...</p>
"
6034885,"Working around ""one executable per project"" in Visual C# for many small test programs","<p>When working with Visual Studio in general (or Visual C# Express in my particular case), it looks like each project can be configured to produce only one output - e.g. a single executable or a library. </p>

<p>I'm working on a project that consists of a shared library and a few application, and I already have one project in my solution for each of those. However, during development I find it useful to write small example programs that can run one small subsystem in isolation (at a level that doesn't belong in the unit tests). </p>

<p>Is there a good way to handle this in Visual Studio? I'd like to avoid adding several dozen separate projects to my solution for each small test program I write, especially when these programs will typically be less than 100 lines of code. I'm hoping to find something that lets me continue to work in Visual Studio and use its build system (rather than moving to something like NAnt).</p>

<p>I could foresee the answer being something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>A way of setting this up in Visual Studio that I haven't found yet</li>
<li>A GUI like NUnit's graphical runner that searches an assembly for classes with defined Main() functions that you can select and run</li>
<li>A command line tool that lets you specify an assembly and a class with a Main function to run</li>

6034888,Silverlight validation of dependent controls?,"<p>I have Silverlight 3 application with two datepickers for Start Date and End Date.
They are data bound to a business object which implements validation logic such that the StartDate must be before the EndDate and the EndDate must be after the StartDate.</p>

<p>So far, so good - both controls display the appropriate validation error when a validation exception is thrown in the respective setter.</p>

<p>My problem is if the user changes the 'other' control such that the 'invalid' date in the first control is now valid, the first control's state does not change (because its setter has not been called).</p>

<p>For example, if I set StartDate to 15 Dec 2009 and EndDate to 10 Dec 2009, the EndDate control correctly goes into the invalid state.  If the user changes the StartDate to 9 Dec 2009, the EndDate control is still marked as invalid because the UI has not called the EndDate setter.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""pdf"" description=""Generates a PDF version of the report by converting the .jrprint file.""&gt;
    &lt;ant dir=""../"" target=""pdf""/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That tells me that it should convert this report into PDF and shoot the file to the parent directory. I made a directory called PDF and use absolute path to shoot it there and all that it did was shoot a build.xml file with no data to it...</p>

<p>The PDF is nowhere to be found. What I am missing here? </p>

<p>Thanks for any help, the jasperforge forum isn't responding to my thread. I don't think this is a very complex problem, so hopefully I can get some help... this is my last step with Jasper!</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

6034902,changing image resolution in Python for a .bmp file,"<p>I want to change the resolution of the .bmp image in python. ( i.e. the pixel/inch information) . Using PIL, for jpg image, for instance, the following code works fine</p>

<p>it's no longer pretty. I've also tried to do it ""backwards"" where I create the z1 tag, then create the z tag and append z1 to it, then append the z tag to the x tag. But I get the same result.</p>

6034907,What MySQL collation/character set should I use for English and Spanish?,"<p>I'm building an PHP5 application with MySQL for English and Spanish speaking. Should I set the character set and collation to UTF8 and then convert everything into the database with mbstring?

<p>I'm using CodeIgniter on most projects. I just noticed the CI Database settings.</p>

6034908,Problems interpreting input cell box expressions,"<p>How do I convert an arbitrary box specification extracted from a cell expression into an input expression?</p>

<p>This came up as a problem with my answer to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/8282605/211232"">Save Mathematica code in <code>FullForm</code> syntax</a>.  In that context, pattern matching was being used to extract box specifications from notebook expressions read using <code>Import</code>.</p>

<p>I thought that <code>ToExpression</code> or <code>MakeExpression</code> would do the job of box interpretation, but in some circumstances they do not.</p>

<p>Consider an input cell that contains the expression:</p>

<pre><code>StringForm[""a = ``"", 1]
</code></pre>

<p>The cell expression for such a cell looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Cell[BoxData[
 RowBox[{""StringForm"", ""["", 
  RowBox[{""\""\&lt;a = ``\&gt;\"""", "","", "" "", ""1""}], ""]""}]], ""Input""]
</code></pre>

<p>I can take the <code>BoxData</code> subexpression from this cell and use <code>ToExpression</code> to obtain the same output as if I had evaluated the original cell:</p>

<pre><code>ToExpression @
  BoxData[
    RowBox[{""StringForm"", ""["", 
      RowBox[{""\""\&lt;a = ``\&gt;\"""", "","", "" "", ""1""}], ""]""}]]
</code></pre>

<p>But now consider the following input expression:</p>

<p><code>StringForm[""<em>a</em> = ``"", 1]</code></p>

<p>You'll have to look closely to see the difference: the <code><em>a</em></code> is in italics.  Here is the corresponding cell expression:</p>

<pre><code>Cell[BoxData[
 RowBox[{""StringForm"", ""["", 
  RowBox[{""\""\&lt;\!\(\*
StyleBox[\""a\"",
FontSlant-&gt;\""Italic\""]\) = ``\&gt;\"""", "","", "" "", ""1""}], ""]""}]], ""Input""]
</code></pre>

<p>If I evaluate this cell normally, I get the expected result.  But if I try applying <code>ToExpression</code> to the <code>BoxData</code> subexpression like before:</p>

<pre><code>ToExpression @
  BoxData[
   RowBox[{""StringForm"", ""["", 
    RowBox[{""\""\&lt;\!\(\*
  StyleBox[\""a\"",
  FontSlant-&gt;\""Italic\""]\) = ``\&gt;\"""", "","", "" "", ""1""}], ""]""}]]
</code></pre>

<p>an error occurs:</p>

<pre><code>StringForm::string : String expected at position 1 in StringForm[]\) = '',
FontSlant-&gt;""\~\(\*\nStyleBox[""a Italic, 1].
</code></pre>

<p>The same kind of error occurs for many, if not all, of the inline string box escape sequences.  I've tried explicitly specifying the form to <code>ToExpression</code> and <code>MakeExpression</code>, but I get the same error.  Which brings me to my question...</p>

<p>What do I have to do to emulate the way Mathematica interprets the boxes from an input cell expression?</p>

6034909,Is it a good idea to have WiFi turned on all the time?,"<p>One of my relatives have internet at home and she has a single desktop computer. Sometimes when family members visit her it would be convenient if their laptop could be attached to the internet and used from anywhere in the house easily. I'm planning to install a wifi router, plug the desktop computer into one of the ports and configure secure wifi access (WPA2) for the visitors.</p>

<p>But I wonder if it's a good idea to have wifi turned on all the time for the occasional visitors if she uses only her own desktop computer most of the time. Is it possible someone can crack this open access point regardless of the security settings? Or it's not probable so I shouldn't worry about it?</p>

<p>It would certainly be convenient to have a permanent wifi access, so visitors can easily connect to the home network. I'm just wondering if keeping the access point constantly open is a wise idea. What do you think? Can it be a problem or is it perfectly all right if wifi access is configured with proper security and encryption?</p>

<p>So this is an example of the Spreadsheet I have.. This is what I wish to be using in my ideal goal. Not what I am using right now.. It was done in MS Excel 2010, using Columns A-BF and Row 1-993</p>

<p><em>Currently</em> my format for working code, I am using manually implemented Arrays.. For example for the iName I have:</p>

<pre><code>char iName[16][25] = {""Scorpion"", ""Poring"", ""Hornet"", ""Familiar"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null"", ""null""};

<p>Defined in a header file (bSystem.h) now to apply, lets say their health variable? I have to have another array in the same Header with corresponding order, like so:</p>

<pre><code>int HP[16] = {1109, 50, 169, 155, 95, 95, 118, 118, 142, 142, 167, 167, 193, 193, 220, 220};
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is, there is a large amount of data to hard code into the various file I need for Monsters, Items, Spells, Skills, ect.. On the original small scale to get certain system made it was fine.. I have been using various Voids in header files to transfer data from file to file when it's called.. But when I am dealing with 1,000+ Monsters and having to use all these variables.. Manually putting them in is kinda.. Ridiculous? Lol...</p>

<p><em>Part 2</em></p>

<p>Now my ideal system for this, is to be able to use the .CSV Files to load the data.. I have hit a decent amount of various issues in this task.. Such as, converting the data pulled from Names to a Char array, actually pulling the data from the CSV file and assigning specific sections to certain arrays... The main idea I have in mind, that I can not seem to get to is this;</p>

<p>I would like to be able to find a way to just read these various variables from the CSV file... So when I call upon the variables like:</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; ""("" &lt;&lt; health &lt;&lt; "" health) VS. "" &lt;&lt; iName[enemy] &lt;&lt; ""("" &lt;&lt; HP[enemy] &lt;&lt; "" health)"";
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>[enemy]</code> is, it would be the ID.. the enemy encounter is in another header (lSystem.h) where it basically goes like;</p>

<pre><code>case 0:
        enemy = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Where 0 would be the first data in the Arrays involving Monsters.. I hate that it has to be order specific.. I would want to be able to say enemy = 1002; so when the combat systems start it can just pull the variables it needs from the enemy with the ID 1002.. </p>

<p>I always hit a few different issues, I can't get it to pull the data from the file to the program.. When I can, I can only get it to store int values to int arrays, I have issues getting it to convert the strings to char arrays.. Then the next issue I am presented with is recalling it and the actual saving part... Which is where part 3 comes in :3</p>

<p><em>Part 3</em></p>

<p>I have attempted a few different things so far and have done research on how to achieve this.. What I have came across so far is..</p>

<p>I can write a function to read the data from let's say mobDB, record it into arrays, then output it to a .dat? So when I need to recall variables I can do some from the .dat instead of a modifiable CSV.. I was presented with the same issues as far as reading and converting..</p>

<p>I can go the SQL route, but I have had a ton of issues understanding how to pull the data from the SQL? I have a PowerEdge 2003 Server box in my house which I store data on, it does have NavicatSQL Premium set up, so I guess my main 2 questions about the SQL route is, is it possible to hook right into the SQLServer and as I update the Data Base, when the client runs it would just pull the variables and data from the DB? Or would I be stuck compiling SQL files... When it is an online game, I know I will have to use something to transfer from Server to Client, which is why I am trying to set up this early in dev so I have more to build off of, I am sure I can use SQL servers for that? If anyone has a good grasp on how this works I would very much like to take the SQL route..</p>

<p>Attempts I have made are using like, Boost to Parse the data from the CSV instead of standard libs.. Same issues were presented.. I did read up on converting a string to a char.. But the issue lied in once I pulled the data, I couldn't convert it?..</p>

<p>I've also tried the ADO C++ route.. Dead end there..</p>

<p>All in all I have spent the last week or so on this.. I would very much like to set up the SQL server to actually update the variables... but I am open to any working ideas that presents ease of editing and implementing large amounts of data..</p>

<p>I appreciate any and all help.. If anyone does attempt to help get a working code for this, if it's not too much trouble to add comments to parts you feel you should explain? I don't want someone to just give me a quick fix.. I actually want to learn and understand what I am using. Thank you all very much :)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong></p>

<p>I don't think this is called ""solved"" but after long try, I decided to just run my test code in the web app instead of running individually from netbean. I had to create web.xml myself since GlassFish does not provide it. (I see sun-web.xml but it wasn't the substitution) Then created servlet, define mapping in the web.xml and added my test code snippet to the servlet and tried on the browser. It worked, successfully obtained data from database.</p>

<p>I wonder what is the reason why it wasn't working when I try running just the Tmp.java (my test file) from Netbean...</p>

6034937,Best practices on how to send emails on clients behalf and avoid being black listed,"<p>I am starting a business providing some online customer relationship management functionality.  I want to allow my clients to create their own email lists.
I also want to allow my clients to be able to initiate to send emails from my web application to the customers in their email lists.</p>

<p>Theoretically, all my clients should have only ""opt-in"" customers in their lists (this will also be part of my terms and conditions with using my service). However, there is no way of policing this.  One way I thought of was to make it compulsory to send each contact an email and asking them to ""opt-in"", but my client is not happy with this because in their case their customers have already opted-in.</p>

<p>Currently, I am running on shared hosting which is allowing my application to send emails, but now it could be happening on a larger scale and I am fearful of my domain being black listed.</p>

<p>The main tips I have seen in other responses including:</p>

<ol>
<li>use the ""Sender"" and ""Return-Path"" properties in the email which I will do.  </li>
<li>provide an ""Unsubscribe"" link.  </li>
</ol>

<p>I looked at using the AuthSMTP to separate my server from the sending of the emails, but I am not sure if this is of benefit (unless my host has an email limit).</p>

<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

I kept the power supply, old hard disk and DVD drive hardware. Windows 7 installed onto the new drive without any problems, and after installing the LAN, audio and other drivers (but not the full driver package) from the motherboard CD, it seemed to work fine, for a few hours or so (I installed Firefox and Dropbox and Avira).</p>

<p>However, we went shopping for a bit and when I returned the power LED was flashing. That seems reasonable for a sleep state, so I tried to wake it up using keyboard, mouse and power button (the box has no other buttons); it's not waking up. Even weirder: even if I disconnect the power supply from the wall socket and reconnect it after 30s or so, the power LED resumes flashing (but the box still won't boot).</p>

<p>How can I reboot or wake it up? I guess I could pull the battery from the motherboard and try to prevent it from ever sleeping again, but I'd prefer to understand why it's not working the way it should be.</p>

6034949,Multiple *NIX Accounts with Identical UID,"<p>I am curious whether there is a standard expected behavior and whether it is considered bad practice when creating more than one account on Linux/Unix that have the same UID. I've done some testing on RHEL5 with this and it behaved as I expected, but I don't know if I'm tempting fate using this trick.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say I have two accounts with the same IDs:</p>

<pre><code>a1:$1$4zIl1:5000:5000::/home/a1:/bin/bash
a2:$1$bmh92:5000:5000::/home/a2:/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>What this means is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can log in to each account using its own password.</li>
<li>Files I create will have the same UID.</li>
<li>Tools such as ""ls -l"" will list the UID as the first entry in the file (a1 in this case).</li>
<li>I avoid any permissions or ownership problems between the two accounts because they are really the same user.</li>
<li>I get login auditing for each account, so I have better granularity into tracking what is happening on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this ability designed or is it just the way it happens to work?</li>
<li>Is this going to be consistent across *nix variants?</li>
<li>Is this accepted practice?</li>
<li>Are there unintended consequences to this practice?</li>
</ul>

6034955,PEAP Trusted Root CA setting not being Applied as directed by Group Policy,"<p>I have created a GPO and linked it to a test OU. This GPO has Windows 7 Wireless Policy that directs the machines to auth on the network with PEAP in computer auth mode. </p>

<p>This auth is being done with certificates. When connecting it should Validate the server certificate, via our NPS server, trusting some third party CA.</p>

<p>Now, the problem lies when these settings actually get applied to a machine, everything carries over except for ""Trusted Root Certification Authorities"" configuration. While in the GPO we have a specific CA trusted, on the client there are no CAs Trusted.</p>

<p>If I configure the machine manually, by configuring the trust root CAs myself, I am able to connect perfectly.</p>

<p>With Explorer backups (burn and burn to disc) I have encountered the ""destination path too long"" error message and it shows the name of a folder ""Debug"" three times.  I have hundreds of folders named ""Debug"" thanks to Visual Studio.  At this moment I'm too angry at Microsoft to write a program to determine my 3 longest paths.

6034962,Generating events from SQL server,"<p>I am looking for a best practice or example of how I might be able to generate events for all update events on a given SQL Server 2008 R2 db. To be more descriptive, I am working on a POC where I would essentially publish update events to a queue (RabbitMq in my case) that could then be consumed by various consumers. This would be the first part of implementing a CQRS query-only data model via event sourcing. By placing on the que anybody could then subscribe to these events for replication into any number of query-only data models. This part is clear and fairly well-defined. the problem I am having is determining the best approach for generating the events out from SQL server. I have been given a few ideas such as monitoring the transaction log and SSIS. However, I'm not entirely sure if these options are adviseable or even feasible.</p>

I'm not sure how to apply that, since right now I'm letting p = 4 and q = 3, so I don't know where inclusion-exclusion would be used (if at all!) since I don't know how elements would be missing.</p>

Currently we are specifically targeting Oracle which would mean we would use the Oracle OLE DB provider and the ODP.NET.  </p>

1. All applications will be in managed code so using native C++ OLEDB would require C++/CLI to work (no PInvoke way to slow). 
2. Application must work with multiple databases in the future, currently just targeting Oracle specifically.  </p>

6034990,SWFObject Audio Player does not play when minimized,"<p>I have a small problem with the <code>SWFObject</code> on my web page.  The behavior is that when the flash player is covered up by another tab or minimized it does not start to play the audio until the tab gets focus again and is visible.  It is using the 2.1 version of <code>SWFObject</code> from <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/</a>.  In order to verify this behavior, load the page, minimize it within 5 seconds and you will notice the code in <code>beginPlay</code> changes the title of the page.  This occurs after the audio should start playing, but it will not start until the browser gets focus again.   Here is a sample of the code to duplicate the problem:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt; 
&lt;head&gt; 
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""swfobject.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""audio-player-uncompressed.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
    &lt;script&gt; 
    function doLoad() {
     AudioPlayer.setup(""player2.swf"", { 
      width: ""350px"",
      animation: ""no"",
      autostart: ""yes"",
      loop: ""yes"",
      buffer: ""5"",
      initialvolume: 100,
     }); 
     AudioPlayer.embed(""flashPlayer""); 
    }

    function beginPlay(){
     setTimeout(function(){
      AudioPlayer.embed(""flashPlayer"", {
       soundFile: ""test.mp3""
      });
      document.title = ""code after the flash player has executed.""
     }, 5000);
    }
    &lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body onload=""doLoad();""&gt;
  This demonstration is to show how either WP Audio Player or SWFObject
  does not build the flash player while the browser is minimized.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href=""javascript:beginPlay();""&gt;click this and minimize quickly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

6035000,Implementing a Count down timer using Service in the background,"<p>What I want to do in my app:
1. When the user opens the app, he will be able to see an already running countdown timer. So in that case I want to show the countdown numbers in a textview that will always update each second.
2. The user will be able to stop it.
3. The user can leave the application, but the countdown should still go on and show updated time when he comes back to the application UI.</p>

<p>So based on the above points, I understand I need to implement Service that does work in the background. I have read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8123231/android-count-down-timer-in-background"">this</a> link but my problem is with the implementation. I am quite at a lost about how to implement that way. That being said, I also cannot think of a way as to showing the time in the UI once the user comes back to the application. I have also seen <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14525533/countdown-timer-stops-running-in-background"">this link</a>  as well, but I am not sure if only implementing CountDownTimer makes it a running Service. 
So how should I proceed and implement it? Any links to specific tutorials/codes are appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem is:
 1. I don't know how to show the countdown on the MainActivity UI apart from this Toast.
 2. It doesn't stop counting when I press Stop Button.</p>

6035004,Spark List sorting issue,"<p>I'm facing strange troubles with a Spark List when I try to sort its data provider.
This is my list (this._albums is an XMLListCollection) :</p>

                    dataProvider=""{this._albums}""
        skinClass=""DataList_AlbumsList""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how I sort it :</p>

<pre><code>protected function onSortChosen(event:IndexChangeEvent):void
{
    var sortFct:Function;
    switch(event.newIndex)
    {

        // ...  

        case 2:
        {
            sortFct = statusAsc;
            break;
        }

        // ...

    }

    var sort:Sort = new Sort();
    sort.compareFunction = sortFct;
    this._albums.sort = sort;
    this._albums.refresh();

}

protected function statusAsc(a:XML, b:XML, fields:Array = null):int
{

    var statusA:String = (""@status"" in a) ? a.@status : ""preparing"";
    var statusB:String = (""@status"" in b) ? b.@status : ""preparing"";

    return ObjectUtil.stringCompare(statusA, statusB);

}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem only occurs when the sort function (statusAsc) is returning 0 (statusA == statusB) at least once: after the sort, some items in the list are missing sometimes, some other times the items are not positioned at the top of the list (there is gap between the top of the list and the items), etc.</p>

<p>What's the problem? The data provider always seems to be correct, and the problem disappears if there isn't any equality while sorting...</p>

<p>For some reason, I can't figure out how to model the relationships. That's where I need help.</p>

<p>Am I missing another join table to make this work? How to I join the visit number to the instance of the test? Given a visit id, how do I find the specific tests given during that visit? How do I model the relationship between the parent and child tables?</p>

<p>Here are three tables I have. The TestABC table is a specific test and there will be many other tests like it. The visit table and everything related to it, minus the linkage to tests, is complete.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Visit](
    [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [ColumnV1] [nchar](10) NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PK_Visit]

    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Test](
        [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,

6035044,Isolating test data in acceptance tests,"<p>I'm looking for guidance on how to keep my acceptance tests isolated. Right now the issue I'm having with being able to run the tests in parallel is the database records that are manipulated in the tests. I've written helpers that take care of doing inserts and deletes before tests are executed, to make sure the state is correct. But now I can't run them in parallel against the same database without uniquely generating the test data fields for each test. For example.</p>

<p>Testing creating a row i'll delete everything where column A = foo and column B = bar
Then I'll navigate through the UI in the test and create a record with column A = foo and column B = bar.</p>

<p>Testing that a duplicate row is not allowed to be created. I'll insert a row with column A = foo and column B = bar and then use the UI to try and do the exact same thing. This will display an error message in the UI as expected.</p>

<p>These tests work perfectly when ran separately and serially. But I can't run them at the same time for fear that one will create or delete a record the other is expecting. Any tips on how to structure them better so they can be run in parallel?</p>

<p>I'm trying to change the class for the selected page. I'm part way there with this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
     var path = location.pathname.substring(1);
     if ( path ){
  $('#navigation a[href$=""' + path + '""]').parent().attr('class', 'selected');
  }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Which changes the class on the parent li. Cool. But what I really want to do is change the class on top level li. In other words if a ""sub sub menu item"" is selected goes all the way up the tree and changes the very first li that contains that link.</p>

<p>Would appreciate any help at all.</p>

The only problem is, when you press done within the first 2 or 3 seconds of the video loading, when the view goes back to the table view, the bar at the top of the screen that tells the time and battery strength etc is no longer there, its just a white space. But if you press done after the first few seconds, then when you go back to the table view, everything is absolutely fine!

Since the UUID should be the key to a <code>Dictionary</code>, is there a way to get the performance comparison between two long, and at the same time, implement the UUID with a small (16 byte) object/struct?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: 
Actually, the tests that I performed measure the performance of the comparison between two UUID, so they have little meaning to evaluate the performance of accessing a Dictionary, because when I invoke the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kw5aaea4.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">ContainsKey method</a>, it calculates the hash value of the UUID.
Should I evaluate the performance in calculating the hash value of the Guid, String, FastUuid, etc.?
How does the ContainsKey method work?</p>

<p>The combobox loads correctly and sets value but when it doesnt set focus to proper item in list. See image below
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vHuY1.png"" alt=""Kendobox""></p>

<p>You can see value is 5.5.1 but it sets to 5.4 which is first item in list. 
I now know that why its happening. On my combobox you can see that i have value set as $root.editFrameworkVersion. In my view model i use subscribe event on that value. See code below</p>

<pre><code>self.editFrameworkVersion.subscribe(function (value) {
        var combobox = $(""#selFrameworkVersion"").data(""kendoComboBox"");

        var callback = function (data) {

            self.editOnlyAlternativeVersions(self.versionListByProductType());

            combobox.select(function (dataItem) {
               return dataItem.Name === value;
            });
            self.editOnlyAlternativeVersions.remove(function (data) {

                return parseInt($(""#selFrameworkVersion"").attr('value')) === parseInt(data.Id());

        };

        loadVersionListByProductType(self.editProductType().Id(), callback);
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>I use this subscribe event to do some logic. In this event i am calling WCF service which loads value again in that combobox and thats why its always set to first value. But its required for me to call that service for some logic. Then i added code in that subscribe event which you already have seen above</p>

<pre><code>combobox.select(function (dataItem) {
               return dataItem.Name === value;
            });

6035069,How to make a threadpool in c++ TBB?,"<p>I might not be measuring this correctly but I have some simple code I'm playing with. I don't think its a threadpool because if I make the work unit very large then the cpu goes to 190-199%(I have dual core) but if I lower make the work unit smaller but much more of those units than my cpu runs the program at 140-160%.</p>

<p>What I think is going on is threads are not being pooled but are being destroyed/created when needed, which is making the program slower when the workloads are smaller.   I'm using <code>tbb::task_scheduler_init</code> to control the number of threads but I don't know how to tell tbb to keep the thread alive.</p>

<p>Here's some code to illustrate the problem:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;list&gt;
#include &lt;tbb/task.h&gt;
#include &lt;tbb/task_group.h&gt;
//#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include ""tbb/task_scheduler_init.h""
#include &lt;boost/thread.hpp&gt;

using namespace tbb;


long fib(long a)
{
    if (a &lt; 2) return 1;

    return fib(a - 1) + fib(a - 2);
}

class PrintTask
{
public:
    void operator()()
    {
        //std::cout &lt;&lt; ""hi world!: "" &lt;&lt;  boost::this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

        fib(10);
    }
};

int main()
{
    tbb::task_scheduler_init init(4); //creates 4 threads
    task_group group;


    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2000000; ++i)
    {
        group.run(PrintTask());
        //std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""done"" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    group.wait();

    return(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>if you change fib to 40-45, the work for each thread becomes large so it hits full speed, but if you use the current setup then the jobs are very small but it does many of them.  </p>

<p>note: A thing I noticed that maybe related is that in the above case, it completely uses my memory(4 gigs free).  Could the slowdown be related to that? Also why would this program take all the memory? What is it storing it in memory, if I'm just calling the thread isn't there a queue telling it how many times to run or is it saving the entire thread in memory to run?</p>

<p>Sorry for the strange questions, I read the tutorial but am confused at its behavior still(although I do get the intended outcome).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

6035070,"How thoroughly should one learn languages like C, ASM, Lisp, Haskell?","<p>Languages like C, Haskell, Lisp, Smalltalk, and assembly language are often touted as things every programmer should know for their effect on the way one thinks about programming, even if they're used very little in real world situations.  However, to really learn a language in depth to the point where you know not only the syntax and semantics but libraries, idioms, all of the relatively obscure features and dark corners, etc. and can get real work done in it requires a pretty serious time commitment.  </p>

<p>When dealing with languages like the above, at what level of depth do you start to get to a point of diminishing returns?  For example, if you're learning C just to expand your horizons, is it ok to stop when you feel you have a pretty good handle on how pointers work and what it's like to manage memory manually, or do you need to do a serious project or two?  When learning assembly language, do you need to be proficient in writing it, or does being able to understand its structure and recognize common idioms from higher level languages, like loops, virtual function calls, stack variables, pointer dereferences, etc. count as ""knowing"" assembly language?  More generally, is it important to learn the whole language, or just to thoroughly wrap your head around the concepts that make it different from more mainstream languages?</p>

<p>This is about my level of knowledge of C and assembly language respectively.  Haskell and Lisp are next on my agenda.  Are these reasonable depths of knowledge for C and assembler?  What are similar benchmarks for Haskell and Lisp?</p>

6035073,EF dynamic proxies issues when Azure Appfabric Cache service is used as session state provider,"<p>We are trying to migrate our on-premise SAAS applicaiton to windows azure, and we have used lot of Entity Framework for a module specifically. As a migration part we are trying to migrate and test the application in phases.  We are trying to using Azure appfabric cache service as a session state provider.  </p>

<p>When I try to configure the session state to appfabric cache we are running in to these issues related to Entity framework, pls see error no 2.  First we got this error no 1. to fix this issue we have the class as [DataContract] and the issue is resolved.</p>

<p>error no 1.
System.Runtime.Serialization.InvalidDataContractException: Type 'XX.XX.XXX' cannot be serialized. Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute attribute, and marking all of its members you want serialized with the DataMemberAttribute attribute.  If the type is a collection, consider marking it with the CollectionDataContractAttribute.  See the Microsoft .NET Framework documentation for other supported types.</p>

<p>error no 2.
The property 'AdXXXXXX' on type 'CaXXXXX_9FDDBE5B2C99F9C5DE2E0DCD2E8CC77D2CB59220D1A3413E91AF5A2B6A23026D' cannot be set because the collection is already set to an EntityCollection.</p>

<p>We are completely lost of how to fix these issues, and when googled a couple of threads tells we need to remove the virtual access modifier for the properties.  But the same code works with out any issues like this on-premise, and the code is generated automatically by the EF on each update of the model.  We are also have other option of going to SQLAzure as session state provider in the second chance, but we are hoping  there are also the same problems may exists as the data need to be serialized  when stored in the session.</p>

6035086,'command not found' error when using subprocess in apache,"<p>I am trying to move my django project from a development server to a production server. I have ironed out almost everything with one (BIG) exception. When I run the following code in the terminal (using <code>python manage.py shell</code>) it works fine, however running through my apache server (with mod_wsgi) it does not run fine.</p>

<p>My code:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    blastn_cline = NcbiblastnCommandline(query=filepath, db=db, evalue=0.1, outfmt=5, out=out, task=""blastn-short"", dust=""no"")
    process = subprocess.Popen(str(blastn_cline),shell=True,stdout = subprocess.PIPE, stderr = subprocess.PIPE)
    proc_out, proc_err = process.communicate()
    err_log = open('/Users/basehunt/logs/ncbi_error_log.log', 'a+')
    err_log.write(""\n""+str(datetime.datetime.now())+"": ""+str(proc_err))
    err_log.close()
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>when I look at my log file <code>ncbi_error_log.log</code> after I run through terminal I get (as an example):</p>

<pre><code>2011-12-17 12:30:54.771292:
</code></pre>

<p>so no error. However, when I run through my apache server I get:</p>

<pre><code>2011-12-17 12:28:59.755323: /bin/sh: blastn: command not found
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried to search extensively for a solution to this problem but can't find anything that gives a fix - though I hope I am missing something glaringly obvious so I can quickly sort this out.</p>

<p>Additional info:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OS X Snow Leopard</p></li>
<li><p>python version is 2.7.2</p></li>
<li><p>django 1.3</p></li>
<li><p>PATH contains the directory with blastn</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If there is any additional code you want to see, let me know.</p>

<p>SOLVED:</p>

<p>by changing</p>

<pre><code>process = subprocess.Popen(str(blastn_cline),shell=True,stdout = subprocess.PIPE, stderr = subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>process = subprocess.Popen('/Users/basehunt/BLAST/ncbi-blast-2.2.25+/bin/'+str(blastn_cline),shell=True,stdout = subprocess.PIPE, stderr = subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>

<p>in order to point absolutely to the function. Many thanks.</p>

6035087,Does clause preventing exposure of PyQt in an application's script API close loophole in license?,"<p>I am currently evaluating using PyQt in a commercial application, and I was surprised to learn that the PyQt Commercial License does not permit you to expose any of the PyQt library in the application's script API. From <a href=""http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/commercial/pyqt"" rel=""nofollow"">the PyQt site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The right to distribute the required PyQt modules and QScintilla library with your applications so long as the users of those applications do not themselves have direct access to PyQt. Otherwise those users themselves become developers and require their own copies of the commercial versions of both PyQt and Qt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this because if they <em>were</em> allowed access to PyQt you would effectively have a 'loophole' in the PyQt Commercial License? This clause closes that loophole, I assume. I was wondering if there must be a similar clause in the GPL and related licenses? Otherwise, surely, you would be able to release an application under an open-source license that was essentially nothing more than a 'shell' application which allowed people to 'script' its behaviour - said behaviour being the creation of a second, non-GPL application using the GPL PyQt bindings.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that this 'loophole' is addressed in the GPL, which must have had <em>many</em> talented lawyers examining it with fine-toothed combs. - Really, I'm trying to learn more about how law affects the life of a coder. The GPL and other open-source licenses seem a good place to start.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Furthermore, would the same system released under the LGPL have a similar problem? Or does that license's more permissive nature mean that there wouldn't be as much of a conflict allowing users access to the library via an application?</p>

6035119,Missing Memory on Windows Server 2008,"<p>I have a windows 2008 x64 server with 8GB of RAM installed.</p>

<p>Task Manager and Resource Monitor both insist that 7.5GB of the RAM is in use.  However, the memory list under Processes (Memory Private Bytes) doesn't add up.  I do have Show Processes from all users checked and hand adding the numbers I come up with about 3.5GB of RAM.</p>

<p>I also looked at the latest copy of SysInternals Process Explorer.  And neither the Private Bytes or Working Set adds up to more than about 3.5GB of RAM in use.</p>

<p>What's going on?</p>

<p>=====</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I bounced the server to see what would happen with the memory utilization.  After boot and regular operations began it sat at 3GB of RAM usage.  18 hours later, it's back up to 6.8GB of usage with no indication as to where the additional 3.5GB or so of RAM is being used.</p>

<p>Here are links to screen shots of the resource monitor and task manager:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.livelyconsulting.com/images/ramusage.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Resource Monitor</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.livelyconsulting.com/images/taskmanager.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Task Manager</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>:
Well, I believe I located the problem.  When I detached one of the larger databases from my sql server the amount of ram shown as ""in use"" dropped drastically.  The Memory Private Bytes count barely moved.  So I'm guessing that SQL server has some way of allocating memory where it doesn't really show up in any of the monitors.  </p>

<p>I went further and created a new database file, then transferred all of the data from the one I detached.  Even though it has the same data, and the same transactions going through it, the memory in use has stayed low.  Maybe there was some corruption in the DB?  I'll leave it to the DB gods and go searching for another ""problem"" ;)</p>

6035126,Set Aptana to collaborate with team members on Dreamweaver?,"<p>I think I want to switch from Dreamweaver to the eclipse based IDE, Aptana. The only real issue stopping me is that I need to be able to collaborate with the other members on my team. Like being able to check-in/out files so we don't override each others work. The other members on my team want to stick with Dreamweaver. So, is there a way to set Aptana to collaborate with team members who are using Dreamweaver?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
If there is no way currently to do this, then I believe there should be a way to program it yourself. For example whenever a file is checked out in dreamweaver a file is created with the same name follwed by .LCK so if you were to check out <strong>file.php</strong> it would create a file called <strong>file.php.LCK</strong> The contents of the file are just <strong>name||email</strong> of the team memeber who checked it out. So if the file is there and the contents is not your name and email then you cannot check it out, if its there and it is your name and email you have it checked out. If you check it out create the LCK file, when you check it in, remove the LCK file. Could there be a way to program this functionality into Aptana/eclipse?</p>

6035127,AudioPlayer iOS and m4a,"<p>I've made an app that plays music using AVAudioPlayer. It either uploads or downloads songs, writes them to Core Data, then recalls them to play when selected. All of the fifteen songs that I've been testing with operate normally using both the iPhone Music Client and my own computer.</p>

<p>However, three of them don't play back on the app. Specifically, I can upload these fifteen songs in any order, clear my Model.sqlite, download them again into the app, and find that three of them just don't play. They do, however, have the right title and artist.</p>

<p>Looking into this, I noticed that the difference is that the non-working files are .m4a. How do I play files of that format with AVAudioPlayer?</p>

<p>EDIT (""Whats ""recalling?"", what URL do you initialise AVAudioPlayer with?""):</p>

<p>There is a server with songs that the user can access through the app. After choosing which subset S to retrieve, the app then downloads S and writes it to a CoreModel using NSManagedObjectContext. Each song is stored as a separate entity with a unique ID and a relationship to a subset entity (in this case, S).</p>

<p>When I ""recall"" using the AppDelegate to get the right song using the context, the data is returned as well. I then initialize the AVAudioPlayer like so:</p>

<pre><code>[[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithData:(NSData *)[currentSong valueForKey:@""data""] error:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>... So I wrote that and then realized that I haven't actually checked out what the error is (silly me). I found that it's <code>OSStatus error 1954115647</code>, which returns as Unsupported File Type. Looking into this a bit more, I found this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4901709/iphone-avaudioplayer-unsupported-file-type"">iPhone: AVAudioPlayer unsupported file type</a>. A solution is presented there as either trimming off bad data in the beginning or initializing from the contents of a URL. Is it possible to find where the data is written to in core model to feed that as the URL?</p>

<p>EDIT: (Compare files. Are they different?)</p>

<p>Yes, they are. I'm grabbing a sample .m4a file from my server, which was uploaded by the app, and comparing it to the one that's in iTunes. What I found is that the file is cut off before offset 229404 (out of 2906191 bytes), which starts <code>20680001 A0000E21</code>. In the iTunes version, <code>0028D83B 6D646174</code> lies before those bytes. Before that is a big block of zeroes preceded by a big block of data preceded by iTunes encoding information. At the very top is more encoding information listing the file as being M4A. </p>

6035131,AWS volume takes forever to attach. How to debug?,"<p>I have a 10GB volume attached to my production EC2 instance (It's only 300MB full). In order to do backups, I created a snapshot of it. Then I created a volume from it, which I tried to attach to another EC2 instance. The volume's status shows ""attaching"" and it never gets attached. I have tried this 4 times, out of which only once it successfully got attached and I could mount it from the EC2 instance. During that one time, it didn't take more than a minute to get attached. All other times it gets stuck in the ""attaching"" state. I've waited for 3-4 hours, but no help. Only thing I can do then is 'Force detach'. I've been using web UI all this time and not CLI.</p>

<p>What might be going wrong? How can I debug this problem?</p>

6035135,RPC vs Direct call,"<p>I spent a week or two implementing and investigating REST for use in a game. I eventually came to the conclusion that REST wasn't quite right - database access is mainly joined and restricted to the player actions.</p>

URL manifestUrl = new URL(""jar:"" + classContainer + ""!/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"");

6035139,Preventing pushes from a branch to a specific remote,"<p>I would like to maintain two forks of a project: one for internal use at the company and another one for opensource. I'd like to have all deploy-specific elements in the source tree (like the deployment recipe and the database configuration and a version-specific bootstrap file and so on). </p>

<p>The way I envisioned it was that i'd have two branches, for example <code>master</code> and <code>internal</code>. In that case one thing I'd like to prevent is pushing the <code>internal</code> branch to Github since that would contain sensitive information. I'd then cherry-pick changes from the <code>internal</code> branch into master.</p>

<p>So how do I configure remotes that a branch is pushed to it's default remote? I have to setup that branch to track another remote than Github?</p>

<p>Or is there a better workflow to developing two forks in lockstep for this kind of situation?</p>

said something interesting about ""imaginary"" (as a technical word in math) not meaning ""not real"".  I understand that imaginary numbers are ""manipulable and usable to do all kinds of things"".   And thus, ""they exist"" at least, in the realm of mathematics.</p>

<p>So my question is this. I was playing around in wxMaxima, and solving polynomials, to get their roots.  In maxima, $\sqrt{-1}$ is represented as %i.<br>
<em>Editor's note: all ""%i""s have been replaced with $i$.</em></p>

<p>My exact question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it common to have the same imaginary result twice with only the sign different (both q and -q are imaginary roots)?  (At first I thought it had reported the same root twice as I overlooked the negative sign.)</p></li>
<li><p>One can easily plot a real root and see how it intercepts the x axis.  How does one ""visualize"" or think of an imaginary root -- does it correspond to a local minimum that does not occur at the x axis? </p></li>
<li><p>What uses do imaginary roots of polynomials have in math?</p></li>

6035161,The RSA key container could not be opened. Windows Server 2008 R2,"<p>I am setting up a second asp.net site on our Windows 2008 R2 server. We use a RSA Key Container to encrypt our connection strings. I created a new Application Pool with all the same settings as our Default Application Pool that is supporting our current site, including using the same user account for the identity. When I try to access the new site I get the following error: The RSA key container could not be opened</p>

<p>If I change the new website to use our Default Application Pool it works. So I try and give the user account in the new Application Pool access to the RSA Key Container using the following command in an Administrator Command Prompt:</p>

<p>aspnet_regiis -pa ""KeyContainerName"" ""dmz\UserName""</p>

<p>I get the following error: The RSA key container was not found.</p>

<p>I run the following command to install the key container:</p>

<p>aspnet_regiis -pi ""KeyContainerName"" ""c:\keys.xml""</p>

<p>I get the following error: Object already exists</p>

<p>I try and run the following command to delete the key container:</p>

<p>aspnet_regiis -pz ""KeyContainerName""</p>

<p>I get this error: The RSA key container was not found. Failed!</p>

<p>So I am completely baffled, one command tells me it already exists which makes sense because I know our one website is using it, but when I tried to delete it tells me it doesn't exist. It works for one app pool but not for a new app pool using the exact same identity? I did this exact same setup on 12 other servers and they all worked fine.</p>

<p>I've tried a lot of different things, but the content-type always remains ""text/xml"".  I'm pretty sure that it's supposed go through as ""application/soap+fastinfoset"" the way I have it set up now. I'm running Axis2 as a standalone, but again I think the problem is that the content type header isn't changing. </p>

<p>I know the options themselves are getting set on the request because I was able to change another option from ""UTF-8"" to ""UTF-16"", and it showed up in the header. Here's the current header output from TCPMonitor:</p>

<p>Despite this, when the message gets to the server and it parses the headers, I get a map <code>ation -&gt; /queue/FOO.BAR</code>, but it's looking for a <code>destination</code> key. I have confirmed that the client is adding the correct map entry to the headers and it is not corrupted all the way through to sending it to the network.</p>

6035170,mod_rewrite prefix problem,"<p>I'm having some difficulties with mod_rewrite. My directory structure (part of it) is:  </p>

<pre><code>index.php
.htaccess
app
  controllers
  models
  views
  ...
  public
    javascripts
    stylesheets
    foo
      bar
</code></pre>

<p>So, as you can see, all static files are in app/public. That's the reason I would like to route requests like:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.example.com/images/logo.png =&gt; app/public/images/logo.png  
http://www.example.com/javascripts/app.js =&gt; app/public/javascripts/app.js  
http://www.example.com/uploads/blog/something =&gt; app/public/uploads/blog/something
</code></pre>

<p>If that file doesn't exist, then it should route to index.php, like:</p>

<pre><code>http://www.example.com/news/show/42 =&gt; index.php 
(Because file app/public/news doens't exist)
</code></pre>

<p><br>
So, this is my current .htaccess, but I think it can be done in more elegant way.  </p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule (png|jpg|gif|bmp|ico)$ app/public/images/$1/$2.$3 [L]
RewriteRule ([^/.]+).js$ app/public/javascripts/$1.js [L]
RewriteRule ([^/.]+).css$ app/public/stylesheets/$1.css [L]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$   index.php    [NC,L,QSA]
</code></pre>

<p>Also, problem with this one is, it only handles images, javascripts and stylesheets, but not all other files. </p>

<p>I know there is:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
</code></pre>

<p>But, I don't know how to route them with prefix ""app/public/""? I tried:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond app/public/%{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond app/public/%{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't work! I also tried using RewriteBase, but it didn't work out.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
I'm using mod_expires, and I'd really like to automate requests like:  </p>

<pre><code>http://www.example.com/images/logo.42.png =&gt; app/public/images/logo.png  
http://www.example.com/javascripts/app.42.js =&gt; app/public/javascripts/app.js  
</code></pre>

<p>So, as you can see, I would like to have optional number between filename and extension, and that number should be ignored (it is only used for future expires).</p>

<p>Previously, I found:  </p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)\.(\d+)(_m_\d+)?\.([^\.]+)$ $1.$4 [QSA]  
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't really understand how it works and does it always work in my example (multiple extensions maybe)?  </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

6035186,"Rails 3 scope, combine condition with aggregate (sum) results in error","<p>I am having what I think is a simple problem chaining two scopes (Rails 3.2.5).</p>

<p>I have a model called <code>Point</code> with fields <code>amount</code> and <code>transaction_date</code>, amongst other.  Users get an amount of points for various activities, and they are ""available"" until used, which happens as part of a transaction, at which point <code>transaction_date</code> is updated, and no longer empty.</p>

<p>So I have a scope like this:</p>

<pre><code>scope :available, where(""transaction_date IS NULL OR transaction_date = ''"")
</code></pre>

<p>and it works great, returning the proper collection of Point objects.  So I can do</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Point.available
=&gt; [#&lt;Point id: 123, amount: 22, transaction_date: nil &gt;][#&lt;Point id: 456, amount: 33, transaction_date: nil &gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>And if I want to know the sum of available points, I can do</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Point.available.sum(""amount"")
=&gt; 55
</code></pre>

<p>But if I try to make another scope like</p>

<pre><code>scope :available, where(""transaction_date IS NULL OR transaction_date = ''"")
scope :total_available, available.sum(""amount"")
</code></pre>

<p>I get the error</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `default_scoped?' for 22:Fixnum
</code></pre>

<p>or if I change the scope so it's <code>sum(""amount"").available</code> I get the error</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `available' for 55:Fixnum
</code></pre>

<p>I can also make the <code>:total_available</code> scope work by adding the condition defined in <code>:available</code>, but that's not very DRY.</p>

<p>In the below picture, i was using setLayout(null) to place buttons and Canvas3D:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kqMN3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>What i did not want here is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canvas3D overlaps buttons.</li>
<li>Canvas3D does not stretch to keep same ratio of picture size / window size so when i resize window it just is in same size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then i tried using <code>setLayout(new BorderLayout());</code> and <code>add(""Center"",component);</code> for the Canvas3D while ""South"", ""West"", ""East"" for the buttons. Below picture is showing the case:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/8JUv4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This looks better but this time another problem comes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buttons are not the size i wanted(stretches to window) and is not at the offset position i wanted.</li>
<li>Buttons also overlap eachother when i put two on the same area like ""South"".</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can i make Canvas3D stretch to window while buttons are just in place i wanted (x,y) and has the size i wanted (h,w) without being overlapped by Canvas3D. I tried different layouts for Canvas3D and Buttons-->failed. Only one layout is showing.</p>

The spreadsheet is in no order and can’t be sorted to show the dates sequentially.  I'm looking for some kind of function or lookup command that tells excel to scan the worksheet containing the dates and return the value of the next date on the list.  For example - if the next date somewhere on the list is Friday and today is Monday, I want excel to give me the Friday date so I know I have an action to take on Friday.  The worksheet is large and scanning the rows and columns by eye looking for the next date is just too difficult.  Hope this makes sense.

6035204,Switching CSS to use asset pipeline in Rails?,"<p>I have a lot of legacy CSS files from what was a Rails 2.x app that got upgraded to Rails 3.2.8, and I want to switch over to using the Rails asset pipeline for stylesheets. The issue is, the CSS stuff is messy in terms of huge lines of code, duplicate file names, and unorganized folder structure.</p>

<p>After looking through individual pages, and trying to add individual stylesheets and folders into the asset pipeline and spending some cycles debugging, I realized there's probably a better approach.</p>

<p>Is there a way to test to make sure the old CSS matches up with the asset pipeline CSS? What are some good tools for testing and debugging CSS? </p>

6035209,Is it possible to prompt a user for a password through a Java dialog from a web application?,"<p>The reason I ask is, I have a web application written in Ruby (1.8.7-p357) with the Sinatra Framework (1.3.2). The interpreter is JRuby (1.6.7.2). I am connecting to an AS/400 (System i v6r1) and when I supply the app with an incorrect password for connecting to the database in the code I am prompted with a Java dialog box to supply the proper password.</p>

<p>This works swimmingly on my development machine (Ubuntu 11.10) using WEBrick. However when I deploy the application with the incorrect password the application hangs.

6035210,Horizontal Frequency Out of Range,"<p>I've been running Ubuntu on one of my servers for about six months. Recently, every time I turn on the computer it POSTs and then right before it gets into Ubuntu my monitor gives me an error saying:</p>

Range:

V: 56-76 Hz

<p>Obviously the horizontal frequency is at 92 kHz, which is apparently out of its range. It's an older (~2005) LiquidVideo 17"" flat screen monitor with the old blue VGA input. I have access to the BIOS but that doesn't really help. If I had another monitor I would hook it up to that to troubleshoot and figure out whether it's the monitor or the graphics card or what. Even if I am able to get into the desktop I don't think there's a setting for horizontal frequency, only vertical. How do I fix this?</p>

Of ~20M tweets, I've generated a list of the N most active users, who I want to try to cluster based on the text of all their tweets.</p>

<p>So I have a list of a few thousand user names, and what I want to do is concatenate the content of all the tweets from each user together, and eventually generate a word count vector for each user.</p>

<p>I can't figure out how to accomplish the concatenation though. I want to be able to write some mapper that takes in each tweet line, and says ""if this tweet comes from a user I'm interested in, map it with key username and value tweetText, otherwise ignore it."" Then it would be simple for the reducer to concatenate the tweets like I want to.</p>

<p>My problem is, how do I tell the mapper about this big list of users that I'm interested in? It seems like it would be nice if the mapper could have a Hashtable with all the users, but I have no idea if that's possible. </p>

<p>Is there a good way to accomplish this, or is the problem just not a good fit for Map/Reduce?</p>

6035285,Creating an API for an ASP.NET MVC site with rate-limiting and caching,"<p>Recently, I've been very interested in APIs, specifically in how to create them. For the purpose of this question, let's say that I have created an ASP.NET MVC site that has some data on it; I want to create an API for this site.</p>

<p>I have multiple questions about this:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What type of API should I create?</strong> I know that REST and oData APIs are very popular. What are the pros and cons of each, and how do I implement them? From what I understand so far, REST APIs with ASP.NET MVC would just be actions that return JSON instead of Views, and oData APIs are documented <a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CreatingAnODataAPIForStackOverflowIncludingXMLAndJSONIn30Minutes.aspx"" title=""creating a simple oData API"">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>How do I handle writing?</strong> Reading from both API types is quite simple. However, writing is more complex. With the REST approach, I understand that I can use HTTP POST, but how do I implement authentication? Also, with oData, how does writing work in the first place?</li>
<li><strong>How do I implement basic rate-limiting and caching?</strong> From my past experience with APIs, these are very important things, so that the API server isn't overloaded. What's the best way to set these two things up?</li>
<li><strong>Can I get some sample code?</strong> Any code that relates to C# and ASP.NET MVC would be appreciated. </li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><sub>While this is a broad question, I think it's not <em>too</em> broad... :)</sub></p>

<p><sub>There are some similar questions to this one that are about APIs, but I haven't found any that directly address the questions I outlined here.</sub></p>

6035292,Is there any interactive programming language where 1.0 is an integer?,"<p>I'm (very) new to all of this programming stuff and I need help with a program I'm making in Python 3. It's designed, at the moment, to find how many numbers between 1 and 10 are divisible by 5. This is my approach:</p>

<pre><code>def five():
    a = 0
    b = 0
    c = 0
    while a &lt;= 9:
        a = a + 1
        b = a / 5
        if type(b) == int and b is not 0:

        else:
            pass
    print c

<p>In this case it's printing ""6"".</p>

<p>The problem is, well, as you might already know, in Python the number 1.0 is not an integer. The only thing I want is to make Python know all numbers with a 0 after the dot are integers, or find an interactive programming language who does, or find another approach.</p>

<p>So the thing is that I want to click one of the values (Value1-7) and the Parameter variable of my ViewModel is changed.
So far it works, as the alert box shows the value I just set.
I now want to reload the PartialView so that <code>@Model.Header</code> as well as <code>@Model.ImageUrl</code> are updated as they depend on the
parameter that I changed.
How can I do this?
Oh by the way, I'm totally new to JavaScript...</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
Simon</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Ok, the two answers above did help a little, but as I am a real JavaScript noob it's kind of hard...<br>
What I have now is:  </p>

<pre><code>@model MyViewModel
&lt;div id=""my-header""&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;@Model.Header&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table id=""my-table"" style=""background-color: #f8f7f8; width:100%;""&gt;
    &lt;tr style=""line-height:18px; background-color: #d6d6d6;""&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value1""&gt;Value1&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value2""&gt;Value2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value3""&gt;Value3&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value4""&gt;Value4&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value5""&gt;Value5&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value6""&gt;Value6&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value7""&gt;Value7&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div id=""my-image""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""@Model.ImageUrl"" alt=""Chart"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $('#my-table th').click(function() {
        alert(this.id);
        @Model.Parameter = this.id;
        $('#my-header').html(""&lt;h4&gt;@Model.Header&lt;/h4&gt;"");
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That is good so far, but I can't manage to manipulate the Property <code>Parameter</code> from my Model class. So the call <code>@Model.Parameter = anyValue;</code> doesn't work.<br>
How can I do this in JavaScript?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
Ok, I finally solved it the way chaZm suggested. The JSON way.<br>
But first of all I changed my ViewModel so that all possible URLs and headers are stored in a <code>Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</code>. Then my PartialView is:  </p>

<pre><code>@model MyViewModel
&lt;div id=""my-header""&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;@Model.Header&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table id=""my-table"" style=""background-color: #f8f7f8; width:100%;""&gt;
    &lt;tr style=""line-height:18px; background-color: #d6d6d6;""&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value1""&gt;Value1&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value2""&gt;Value2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value3""&gt;Value3&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value4""&gt;Value4&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value5""&gt;Value5&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value6""&gt;Value6&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style=""cursor:pointer"" id=""value7""&gt;Value7&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div id=""my-image""&gt;
    &lt;img src=""@Model.ImageUrl"" alt=""Chart"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $('#my-table th').click(function() {
        var urls = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(@Model.Urls));
        var url = urls[this.id];
        $('#my-image').html(""&lt;img src='"" + url + ""' alt='Chart' /&gt;"");
        var headers = @Html.Raw(Json.Encode(@Model.Headers));       
        var header = headers[this.id];
        $('#my-header').html(header);
    });
&lt;/script&gt;

6035304,Example of Observable.Throw,"<p>I'm kinda new to Observables so I'm just looking for an example that will set me in the right direction (tutorial maybe?). So here it is - I want to create async <code>Observable</code> and thow an <code>Exception</code> from it. Here is my example:</p>

<pre><code>    protected IObservable&lt;Tuple&lt;DataPart1, DataPart2&gt;&gt; LoadAllDataFunc(string FileName)
    {
        return Observable.Start&lt;Tuple&lt;DataPart1, DataPart2&gt;&gt;(() =&gt;
        {
            ConfigReaderWriter readerWriter = new ConfigReaderWriter();
            try
            {
                readerWriter.UnpackFile(fileName, out DataPart1, out DataPart2);
                return Tuple.Create(DataPart1, DataPart2);
            }
            catch (Exception exp_gen)
            {
                Observable.Throw&lt;Exception&gt;(exp_gen);
                return null;
            }
        });
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I don't think I'm not throwing <code>Exception</code> correctly. For example - any Subscriber:</p>

<pre><code>    internal IObservable&lt;DataPart2&gt; GetProject()
    {
        if (this.GlobalDataPart2 != null)
            return Observable.Return(GlobalDataPart2);

        IObservable&lt;Project&gt; receivedData = null;

        var loadAll = LoadAllDataFunc(this.GlobalFileName).Subscribe(
                data =&gt; { receivedData = Observable.Return(data.Item1); },
                (ex) =&gt; { Observable.Throw&lt;Exception&gt;(ex); }
            );

        return receivedData;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>will not receive <code>Exception</code> from <code>LoadAllDataFunc</code> ? Even <strong>if</strong> exception occurred the Subscriber will receive <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>So - what is correct way to throw exception from Observable?</p>

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

<p>In Host B landingpage.aspx, when you arrive without a cookie, we set a cookie and redirect you to the <em>relative</em> url <strong>/landingpage.aspx</strong> :</p>

&lt;script runat=server&gt;
    override protected void  OnLoad(EventArgs e)

<p>In all browsers I've tried, you arrive at HOSTB/landingpage.aspx. However, in IE, you arrive at HOSTA/landingpage.aspx. </p>

<p>I know what's happening and it's that the relative redirect upon landing on HOSTB is interpreted as relative to the original url's path and normally I would just change the relative url to an absolute one, but here's the rub: <strong>I don't control HOSTB</strong> so I can't do that. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to make that redirect stick?</strong></p>

<p>For added clarity, here's the entire conversation as seen by fiddler along with the troublesome redirect highlighted using one machine by both IP and Name to substitute for the two domains. You can see that I arrived at 10.0.20.10/landingpage.aspx, but upon that relative redirect, I actually went back to the prior domain XPS730.</p>

6035316,Path-Dependent type inside class value in Scala,"<p>I would like to give a value of a type with an abstract type to a class and later use it's path dependent type. Look at the following example (using Scala 2.10.1):</p>

<pre><code>trait Foo {
  type A
  def makeA: A
  def useA(a: A): Unit
}

object Test {

  class IntFoo extends Foo {
    type A = Int
    def makeA = 1
    def useA(a: Int) = println(a)
  }

  class FooWrap(val a: Foo) {
    def wrapUse(v: a.A) = a.useA(v)
  }

  val foo = new IntFoo

  /* Path dependent locally */
  val bar = foo  
  bar.useA(foo.makeA)   // works

  /* Path dependent through class value */
  val fooWrap = new FooWrap(foo)

  fooWrap.a.useA(foo.makeA)  // fails
  // error: type mismatch; found : Int required: Test.fooWrap.a.A

  fooWrap.wrapUse(foo.makeA) // fails
  // error: type mismatch; found : Int required: Test.fooWrap.a.A

}
</code></pre>

<p>First, I do not understand the fundamental difference between the local and the class-value case (note the public, immutable value) and why the type checking fails (because obviously <code>Test.fooWrap.a.A =:= foo.A</code>). Is this a limitation of the Scala compiler?</p>

<p>Second, how can I achieve what I am trying to do?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>It seems that this can be achieved by using generics and inline type-constraints:</p>

<pre><code>class FooWrap[T](val a: Foo { type A = T }) {
  def wrapUse(v: T) = a.useA(v)
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, in my case, <code>A</code> is actually a higher-kinded type, so the example becomes:</p>

<pre><code>trait Foo {
  type A[T]
  def makeA[T]: A[T]
  def useA(a: A[_]): Unit
}

object Test {

  class OptFoo extends Foo {
    type A[T] = Option[T]
    def makeA[T] = None
    def useA(a: A[_]) = println(a.get)
  }

  class FooWrap(val a: Foo) {
    def wrapUse(v: a.A[_]) = a.useA(v)
  }

  val foo = new OptFoo

  /* Path dependent locally (snip) */

  /* Path dependent through class value */
  val fooWrap = new FooWrap(foo)

  fooWrap.a.useA(foo.makeA)  // fails
  // polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;
  // found : [T]None.type required: Test.fooWrap.a.A[_]

  fooWrap.wrapUse(foo.makeA) // fails
  // polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;

<h1>Update #1</h1>

<p>To give specifics, the setup is as follows.</p>

<h3>Production DB cluster</h3>

<p>Dell R710, with 2 x Broadcom 5709's (iSCSI and TOE offload capable, using Dell's Multipathing IO software).  And yes, I've seen the 'Broadcom - die mutha' post :S</p>

<h3>Switch</h3>

<p>2 Juniper EX4200-48T's acting as a single virtual switch</p>

<p>One connection from each Broadcom NIC on each Cluster connects to one switch
And there are 2 Gigabit connections from each Switch to the SAN.</p>

<h3>SAN</h3>

<p>Dell EqualLogic PS6000E iSCSI SAN, packed out with 16 (14 + 2 hotspare) 2tb 7200rpm drives</p>

<p>As far as I know, and from how I think this should work, we should theoretically be getting 200mbps, which as you can see, we're not.</p>

<h1>Update 2</h1>

<p>To give a bit more context, here's a graph showing the average mbps for 4 separate runs.</p>

<p>For reference, the Y axis is MBPS, and the X axis is the IO type (random or sequential), Pending IO's and the operation (read vs write).</p>

<p>Images disabled, so here's a link - <a href=""http://imgur.com/MpXtw"" rel=""nofollow"">Graph showing average results for 4 SQLIO runs</a></p>

<p>There are 2 things concerning me here - </p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, the random read throughput is lower than I'd have expected</li>
<li>And secondly, random write IO's plateau out at 110mbps, whereas <a href=""http://www.wmarow.com/strcalc/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> suggests the array should be capable of more than that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this a roughly expected pattern for this type of setup?  And is there anything else that looks out of place or wrong here?</p>

<p>Specifically, I don't see why delegate objects are needed instead of event handlers.  For instance, when the user presses a button, it is handled with an event (<code>UITouchUpInside</code>), but when the user finishes inputting to a text box and closes it with the 'Done' button, the action is handled by calling a method on the text box's delegate (<code>textFieldShouldReturn</code>).</p>

6035345,"Deep copy onto existing object and .Update() works, but simply .Merge()'ing does not?","<p>I was receiving the following error from NHibernate when attempting to saved a detached object:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a different object with the same identifier value was already
  associated with the session</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After doing some reading, I found that I should be calling Merge on any object that has changes made to it client-side if another instance of that object already existed in Session.</p>

<p>As such, I generated the following bit of code:</p>

<pre><code>public void SavePlaylist(Playlist playlist)
{
    try
    {
        NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.BeginTransaction();
        playlist.ValidateAndThrow();

        Playlist knownPlaylist = PlaylistDao.GetById(playlist.Id);
        if (knownPlaylist == null)
        {
            throw new Exception(""Shouldn't be null inside of SavePlaylist"");
        }

        if(!ReferenceEquals(knownPlaylist, playlist))
        {
            PlaylistDao.Merge(playlist);
        }
        else
        {
            PlaylistDao.Update(playlist);
        }

        NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.CommitTransaction();
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        Logger.Error(exception);
        throw;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seemed pretty OK to me, but calling Merge on Playlist generated odd side-effects. My Playlist object maintains a list of PlaylistItem objects:</p>

<pre><code>public class Playlist
{
    [DataMember(Name = ""id"")]
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Name = ""userId"")]
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Name = ""title"")]
    public string Title { get; set; }
    [DataMember(Name = ""position"")]
    public int Position { get; set; }
    //Use collection interfaces instead of concrete collections, so NHibernate can inject it with its own collection implementation.
    [DataMember(Name = ""items"")]
    public IList&lt;PlaylistItem&gt; Items { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>and these Items were failing to save after calling Merge. Upon inspecting the objects, they looked fine, but the SQL query being generated show the PlaylistItem's PlaylistId to be null, which it quite clearly was not before calling Commit.</p>

<p>However, after a bit of fussing, I decided on the following change. Instead of calling Merge, I simply did a deep copy from my detached object back into my cached object:</p>

<pre><code>//new SavePlaylist code that works
NHibernateSessionManager.Instance.BeginTransaction();
playlist.ValidateAndThrow();

Playlist knownPlaylist = PlaylistDao.GetById(playlist.Id);
if (knownPlaylist == null)
{
    throw new Exception(""Shouldn't be null inside of SavePlaylist"");
}

knownPlaylist.CopyFromDetached(playlist);
PlaylistDao.Update(knownPlaylist);

    public void CopyFromDetached(Playlist playlist)
    {
        Id = playlist.Id;
        UserId = playlist.UserId;
        Title = playlist.Title;
        Position = playlist.Position;
        //TODO: NOT SOLD ON THIS.
        Items.Clear();
        Items.ToList().AddRange(playlist.Items);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This works great as long as I don't remove the original reference to the Items collection. However, it all seems a bit.. messy and seems to hint that I'm doing something wrong. I'd like some advice on how I should be handling updating from detached objects. Thanks!</p>

6035347,Is there an environment-agnostic way to detect Javascript Host Objects?,"<p>I'm writing a Javascript stacktrace library. The library needs to detect wether a particular object or function was created by the programmer or was there as part of the environment (including built-in objects). Host objects are becoming a bit problematic due to their unpredictable behaviour, so I'm after an environment-agnostic way to determine if a particular object in Javascript is a host object (see <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">ECMAScript 3</a> - 4.3.8). However, distinguishing host objects from native objects and primitive values is useful for programmers in other projects, particularly in browser-less environments, so I'd like to focus on that, rather than the problems host objects cause in my library or on distinguishing programmer-created objects.</p>

<p>So far I've only been able to come up with solutions that depend on the environment running javascript code. For example:</p>

<pre><code>// IE Only: does not implement valueOf() in Host Objects
var isHost = (typeof obj === 'object' &amp;&amp; typeof obj.valueOf === 'undefined');

// Firefox Only: Host objects have own constructor
var isHost = (obj.constructor &amp;&amp; obj.hasOwnProperty('constructor'));
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that jQuery's own <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isPlainObject/"" rel=""nofollow"">isPlainObject()</a> method is also dependent on environment, and that the logic is rather convoluted. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is because thats the nature of the beast with host objects (since their behaviour is defined by the environment), but I would like to dig a bit further to see if this is possible and was wondering if somebody has run across this particular problem before and has a solution ready.</p>

<p>So. Does anybody know a simple platform-independent solution to test for Host Objects? And if it runs in a browser-less environment such as Node or Rhino all the better for it.</p>

<p>Possible approaches (that may not work):</p>

<ul>
<li>Testing for characteristics of host objects seems like a lost cause, given that there is no specification for their behaviour, however testing whether the object is part of the ES3 specification may be a possibility. </li>
<li>I have tried using <code>Object.prototype.toString()</code> given that its defined quite specifically, but the results are inconclusive as some environments (namely IE) choose to return the same value for native and host objects.</li>
<li>It may be possible to do this by checking whether the ultimate <code>constructor</code> of an object through the prototype chain really is an <code>instanceof Function</code>.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>
  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6168880/why-is-such-a-function-definition-not-allowed-in-haskell"">Why is such a function definition not allowed in haskell?</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I made a haskell function called <code>funlist</code>. What it does is it takes a starting value, and a list of functions, and applies all of the functions in the list to the starting value.</p>

<pre><code>funlist thing [function] = function thing
funlist thing (function:functions) = funlist (function thing) functions
funlist _ _ = error ""need a list of functions""
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this function is that it has a type of <code>funlist :: t -&gt; [t -&gt; t] -&gt; t</code>. That type means that while ghc will allow a list of functions that don't convert the starting value to a completely different type (e.g <code>[sin,cos,tan]</code> will be allowed), a function that converts the starting value to a different type (e.g <code>show</code>) will generate an error because that function doesn't match the type signature.</p>

<p>This isn't how the function should work. It should be able to take a list of functions that change the starting values type (e.g. <code>[sin,show]</code>). This function basically converts <code>funlist 5 [sin,cos,tan,isInfinite,show]</code> to <code>show $ isInfinite $ tan $ cos $ sin $ 5</code>, and while the latter works, the former doesn't.</p>

<p>Is there any way that I can get this function to work properly?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I know about <code>.</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, I'm just wondering if there's a way to make this work.</p>

6035360,Binding components to wixlib in VS2010 + Wix 3.6,"<p>I'm converting our wix project from 3.0 to 3.6.  The wixlibs generated in the VS2010/wix3.6 set up are not binding the components to the wixlib.  In VS2008/wix3.0 there is a checkbox in the library wixproj properties GUI under the Build tab to force binding files into the library file.  I'm not seeing this in the VS2010/wix3.6 wixproj Build tab.  </p>

<p>Where did this move and/or how can I force files to be bound?  This is pretty fundamental to how our modularized applications consume upstream modules.  </p>

6035361,Automatically checking for NULL relationships with LINQ queries,"<p>I am using LINQ to SQL to handle the database querying for an application I am working on.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this example, imagine I have some tables like so</p>

<pre><code>- Company
- Product
- Item
- Order
</code></pre>

<p>and lets say a <code>Company</code> has 0 or more <code>Products</code>, a <code>Product</code> has 0 or more <code>Items</code>, and an <code>Item</code> has 0 or more <code>Orders</code>.</p>

<p>Now lets so I have obtained a list of <code>Orders</code>, something like:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Order&gt; myOrders = GetMyOrders();
</code></pre>

<p>Now lets say I want to query the orders for a particular <code>Company.Name</code>, but have a situation where each table parent ID can be <code>NULL</code> (I know this doesn't seem logical with my example data but it is just an example)</p>

<p>Making the assumption that there are no <code>NULL</code> parent IDs I could do this:</p>

<pre><code>var filteredOrders = myOrders.Where(x =&gt; x.Item.Product.Company.Name == ""Company1"");
</code></pre>

<p>This would work fine, however, because there could be <code>NULL</code> parent ID values, I need to check each parent object to ensure it is not <code>null</code> before querying the next parent (otherwise I will get an exception). So I do something like:</p>

<pre><code>var filteredOrders = myOrders.Where(x =&gt; 
    x.Item != null &amp;&amp;
    x.Item.Product != null &amp;&amp;
    x.Item.Product.Company != null &amp;&amp;
    x.Item.Product.Company.Name == ""Company1"");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So my question</strong>: Is there a better way (in terms of readability and ease of coding) to do this than having to include all the null checks? Any null parents found along the way should result in exclusion from the resulting list.</p>

<p>Please no suggestions for preventing null parents, the database will not be changing (and is perfectly valid anyway)</p>

<p>Here mdadm was very clear about what it needs, given that this IS a raid1 array, but as it is one part of mirror copy, it must be able to work on its own:</p>

Essentially, applying the box model to div-containers that can have other closed shapes (such as circles, triangles, pentagons, etc).</p>

6035402,.net winform talking to Silverlight,"<p>Im currently working on registration of our application. Basically we have a simple concurrent licensing system so when the user logs in we store their computer name and logon name to uniquely identify them. This is done from a simple winforms app that allows us to retrieve this data.</p>

<p>We now have a brother silverlight project that must work in the same licensing. The situation being that if a user logs into the winforms app they will use one license and if they log in on our silverlight app it will still use the one license because they are accessing it from the same computer.</p>

<p>The problem is that we cannot retrieve the clients machine and logon name with the silverlight application.</p>

<h2>I had to override the getReadableDatabase() and getWritableDatabase() in my custom DBHelper class.</h2>

<p>I am facing a unique kind of problem.</p>

<p>Until now, I have written Android apps that have used one SQLite DB internally on the phone memory, and it works perfectly. Now I wanted to add another DB and wanted to store it on the SD card. I did this by modifying the DatabaseHelper class that we usually use. I have also written a script that transfers the db from the assets folder to the SD card for one DB and the internal memory location for another.</p>

<p>Now the problem that I am facing is that when I try to access the external DB, android creates an internal DB in the /data/data/package_name/databases folder and thus I end up getting <strong>no such table exception</strong>.</p>

6035416,Checking for empty arrays: count vs empty,"<p>This question on '<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2216052/how-to-tell-if-a-php-array-is-empty/2216062#2216062"">How to tell if a PHP array is empty</a>' had me thinking of this question</p>

<p>Is there a reason that <code>count</code> should be used instead of <code>empty</code> when determining if an array is empty or not?</p>

<p>My personal thought would be if the 2 are equivalent for the case of empty arrays you should use <code>empty</code> because it gives a boolean answer to a boolean question. From the question linked above, it seems that <code>count($var) == 0</code> is the popular method. To me, while technically correct, makes no sense. E.g. <strong>Q: $var, are you empty? A: 7</strong>. Hmmm...</p>

<p>Is there a reason I should use <code>count == 0</code> instead or just a matter of personal taste?</p>

<p>As pointed out by others in comments for a now deleted answer, <code>count</code> will have performance impacts for large arrays because it will have to count all elements, whereas <code>empty</code> can stop as soon as it knows it isn't empty. So, if they give the same results in this case, but <code>count</code> is potentially inefficient, why would we ever use <code>count($var) == 0</code>?</p>

<p>A fellow student in my Calculus and Analytic Geometry I class asked what some applications of higher order (e.g., ( $y^{(n)}$, $n\geq 4$) ) derivatives might be.  Our instructor (masters level faculty) did not know of one.  It's got me curious...</p>

"
6035421,Learn LinqToSql or stick with ADO.NET?,"<p>I'm debating what technology to use for an upcoming ASP.NET project.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I will be using Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (.NET Framework 3.5)</li>
<li>The back-end will be a SQL Server 2005 database (or possibly 2008)</li>
<li>Code will be written in C#</li>
<li>I already have experience with LinqToObjects and LinqToXml</li>
<li>I also have experience with ADO.NET and some libraries already built</li>
<li>The project is relatively small</li>
<li>The website will feature about five screens</li>
<li>The database will have maybe six or seven tables </li>
<li>There will be maybe 25-50 active users</li>
<li>Transactions per day will probably be about 5-10 tops</li>
<li>Minimal personal data will be stored</li>
<li>The consequences of failure or the site getting hacked would be minimal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write stored procedures and call them with ADO.NET. I can still use LinqToObjects once I'm done populating my <code>DataSet</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Leverage what I know of Linq already to learn LinqToSql.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>

<p>I already know how to do option 1, but I'd really like to use Linq exclusively. The problem with option 2 is that, according to everything I've read, LinqToSql will probably be deprecated in favor of Entity Framework.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>How steep is the learning curve for LinqToSql if you're already familiar with other Linq technologies?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it worth investing <em>any</em> time in learning LinqToSql given that it may not be further developed by Microsoft?</p></li>
<li><p>Will understanding LinqToSql help me to one day understand Entity Framework or are they too different?</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, which option would you recommend for my situation?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I don't want this to get lost in the comments: marc_s pointed out that LinqToSql <em>is</em> being further developed, at least as of .NET 4.0. Link: <a href=""http://damieng.com/blog/2009/06/01/linq-to-sql-changes-in-net-40"" rel=""nofollow"">http://damieng.com/blog/2009/06/01/linq-to-sql-changes-in-net-40</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know if this means LinqToSql has a future after all, but it does make learning that technology a little more appealing.</p>

<p>One thing I didn't ask in my original post but should have: Are the flaws in Entity Framework likely to affect <em>this</em> project?</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers so far.</p>

<p><strong>Further Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Here is a list of LinqToSql drawbacks, based on some of the comments below:</p>

<ol>
<li>You must continually update the tables and items in the designer as you make changes to the underlying database. There is no way to ""refresh"" or ""sync"" it so that it automatically recognizes changes.</li>
<li>Version control is complicated by the fact that the designer does not generate the underlying files in a consistent order.</li>
<li>The LinqToSql designer generates different code than SqlMetal.</li>
<li>There are issues/bugs involving eager loading.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these, item 1 is the greatest concern to me. Even with a small project, change is inevitable. I remember once trying to use the Windows Forms designer to map to a database, and it blew up in my face so many times, I abandoned it in favor of rolling my own ADO.NET helper classes.</p>

<p>However, it does seem like SqlMetal might be able to handle my needs perfectly. I run a command, it regenerates everything from scratch from the database, I'm done. If I keep my database simple (just tables--no stored procedures, views, or functions), perhaps SqlMetal is all I'll need.</p>

<p>""Processed"" instead of ""Complete""</p>

<p>""Void"" instead of ""Cancelled""</p>

<p>However, it does not appear to work for files downloaded by a Flash app, such as xml and images. </p>

<li>Is there any way to get the files downloaded by Flash to refresh with a keyboard shortcut?

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Upon further investigation, I think I was mistaken initially. The .swf does indeed get refreshed, but some other items (xml &amp; images) that are downloaded by the flash app do not. Manually clearing the browser cache is enough to force those other items to refresh, without having to mess with the <a href=""http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Flash cache manager</a>. A shift-refresh is enough to do the same job in Firefox without having to manually clear Firefox's cache. Could this be a Chrome browser bug?</p>

6035451,Wifi hosts can't contact one another (but wired hosts on the same vlan can),"<p>Our current network is vlan'd, and the wifi network is on its own separate vlan (130).
To connect to the 130 vlan, you connect to the access point (a HP MSM310), which is connected to an HP Procurve 2510-48G switch. In order to do some testing, a developer requires a box on the 130 subnet, that can be accessed by wireless hosts.</p>

<p>The issue is that clients connected directly to the switch on a port set to the 130 vlan can talk to each other absolutely fine.</p>

<p>For example, my laptop is connected to port 37 on the switch. That port is set as 'untagged' on vlan 130. There is a server connected to port 38 (also untagged, vlan 130). They can contact each other fine. The AP is connected to port 43, tagged vlan 130 and 138, though setting port 43 as untagged 130 doesn't resolve the issue.</p>

<p>I'm currently trying to determine whether this is an issue with the access point or the switch. I'd imagine it's the AP, as comms between hosts wired directly works fine.</p>

<p>===== SOLVED =====</p>

<p>As Bart mentioned, it was an issue with the AP isolating clients. The location of this setting was rather awkward to find. From the VSC tab on the AP's web interface, had to click the community's name, and edit the 'Wireless Security Filters'. Fixed the issue by turning this off, though I'm looking in to setting it a little more securely. There's a 'custom' box, that would allow me to specify only certain boxes rather than 'everyone can contact everyone' mode.</p>

6035459,OpenSSL for Apache Harmony on Android,"<p>I happened to chance upon the file
""org_apache_harmony_xnet_provider_jsse_NativeCrypto.cpp"" in the

<p>I learn that this file seems to be the JNI wrapper that Apache Harmony
provider uses to call the under the hood openssl engine for some of
its functionality like ssl, signature verification and digest
calculation.</p>

<p>Can somebody clarify the following for me:</p>

<p>1) I want to add a few printf statements and see it on the ""adb
logcat"" command. I tried adding printf here and there... Where/how are
these files getting compiled? There is a sub.mk(make file) provided
along, but who calls this?</p>

<p>After I added the printf statements, I just did an android ""make"" but
in the end I never get to see these. How do I go about now?</p>

<p>2)Is JNI wrapper for openssl used by Apache only for the three
functionality I said or are there more?</p>

<p>If I have to allow my Apps to use ssl, do I also have to extend this
JNI wrapper to allow it to call other algorithms/functions etc(for eg.
RSA)</p>

<p>""...What you want to return, however, is not this, because this is the address of the object. You want to return the object itself, and that is symbolized by *this.

6035465,Automatic HTML preloader,"<p>I've an page that will load chunks of HTML using ajax. All those fragments will have images and some of them will be specified in a separate CSS using background-image. I wanted to write a pre-loader, so that the loaded chunk will show up only when all the loading is complete. If all the images would have been in the HTML chunk, I would load it, put it in a hidden element, then look for all the img tags and control if they are loaded (or put some callbacks in the load method). The problem is CSS I can't do that so easily... So the only way that comes to my mind is to have a separate xml file with all the image locations and use it to create IMG elements, load them and when they are loaded display the chunk (so the images have already been pulled from the server).

6035476,Is Gap-3SAT NP-complete even for 3CNF formulas where no pair of variables appears in significantly more clauses than the average?,"<p>In this question, a 3CNF formula means a CNF formula where each clause involves <em>exactly</em> three <em>distinct</em> variables.  For a constant 0&lt;<i>s</i>&lt;1, Gap-3SAT<sub><i>s</i></sub> is the following promise problem:</p>

<p><strong>Gap-3SAT<sub><i>s</i></sub></strong><br>
<em>Instance</em>: A 3CNF formula φ.<br>
<em>Yes-promise</em>: φ is satisfiable.<br>
<em>No-promise</em>: No truth assignments satisfy more than <i>s</i> fraction of the clauses of φ.</p>

<p>One of the equivalent ways to state the celebrated PCP theorem [AS98, ALMSS98] is that there exists a constant 0&lt;<i>s</i>&lt;1 such that Gap-3SAT<sub><i>s</i></sub> is NP-complete.</p>

<p>We say that a 3CNF formula is <em>pairwise B-bounded</em> if every pair of distinct variables appears in at most <i>B</i> clauses.  For example, a 3CNF formula (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>∨<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>∨<i>x</i><sub>4</sub>)∧(￢<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>∨￢<i>x</i><sub>3</sub>∨<i>x</i><sub>4</sub>)∧(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>∨<i>x</i><sub>3</sub>∨￢<i>x</i><sub>5</sub>) is pairwise 2-bounded but not pairwise 1-bounded because e.g. the pair (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>4</sub>) appears in more than one clause.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question</strong>.  Do there exist constants <i>B</i>∈ℕ, <i>a</i>&gt;0, and 0&lt;<i>s</i>&lt;1 such that Gap-3SAT<sub><i>s</i></sub> is NP-complete even for a 3CNF formula which is pairwise <i>B</i>-bounded and consists of at least <i>an</i><sup>2</sup> clauses, where <i>n</i> is the number of variables?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pairwise boundedness clearly implies that there are only O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) clauses.  Together with the quadratic lower bound on the number of clauses, it roughly says that no pair of distinct variables appears in significantly more clauses than the average.</p>

<p>For Gap-3SAT, it is known that <em>the sparse case is hard</em>: there exists a constant 0&lt;<i>s</i>&lt;1 such that Gap-3SAT<sub><i>s</i></sub> is NP-complete even for a 3CNF formula where each variable occurs exactly five times [Fei98].  On the other hand, <em>the dense case is easy</em>: Max-3SAT admits a PTAS for a 3CNF formula with Ω(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) distinct clauses [AKK99], and therefore Gap-3SAT<sub><i>s</i></sub> in this case is in P for every constant 0&lt;<i>s</i>&lt;1.  The question asks about the middle of these two cases.</p>

<p>The above question arose originally in a study of quantum computational complexity, more specifically two-prover one-round interactive proof systems with entangled provers (<a href=""http://qwiki.stanford.edu/index.php/Complexity_Zoo%3aM#mipstar21"" rel=""nofollow"">MIP<sup>*</sup>(2,1)</a> systems).  But I think that the question may be interesting in its own right.</p>

6035478,How to push elements into a stack using an array of void* as data structure?,"<p>Lately I've been writing code in C for a generic stack using an array of void pointers. After doing some tests everything seemed to be fine, until this last test:</p>

<pre><code>while(i &lt; 9) {
    push_pila(mi_pila,(int*)&amp;i);
    i++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I'm passing an <code>i</code> as an argument into the <code>push_pila</code> function. This is the code for the <code>push_pila</code> function in the stack:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
        void **vec;
        int tope;
        int16_t max_elementos;
    }PILA;

int push_pila(PILA *mi_pila,void *val) {
    if(pila_llena(mi_pila)) {
        return -1;
    }
    else {
        mi_pila-&gt;tope = mi_pila-&gt;tope + 1;
        mi_pila-&gt;vec[mi_pila-&gt;tope] = val;
        return 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is where the problem is, because my stack is an array of <code>void*</code> containing the values of the address of <code>val</code>. When I pass the value of <code>i</code> I'm passing the address of it. The problem in this case is that all the values inside the stack will contain the same address therefore all the value in the stack will be the same, so when I pop the stack using the pop function I will return the same value which is the last value of <code>i</code>, in my case <code>9</code>.</p>

<p>Is there any solution to this problem?. Or is just that this is not the best way to push elements in the array?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Canvas x:Name=""ParentCanvas"" PreviewMouseDown=""Canvas_MouseDown"" MouseMove=""Canvas_MouseMove""&gt;
  &lt;WrapPanel&gt;

    &lt;!-- controls are all in here ... --&gt;
  &lt;/WrapPanel&gt;
&lt;/Canvas&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the code behind:</p>

<pre><code>    private Point _mousePosition;
    private Point _lastMousePosition;

    private void Canvas_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
    {
        _lastMousePosition = e.GetPosition(ParentCanvas);
        e.Handled = true;
    }

    private void Canvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        _mousePosition = e.GetPosition(ParentCanvas);
        var delta = _mousePosition - _lastMousePosition;

        if(e.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed &amp;&amp; delta.X != 0)
        {
            var transform = ((TranslateTransform)_wrapPanel.RenderTransform).Clone();
            transform.X += delta.X;
            _wrapPanel.RenderTransform = transform;
            _lastMousePosition = _mousePosition;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This all works fine</p>

<p>But what I want to do is make it so that when a users clicks to drag, the items within the WrapPanel <strong>dont</strong> respond (i.e. the user is only browsing), but when the user clicks (as in a full click) then they do respond to the click.</p>

<p>Just like how the iphone works, when you press and drag directly on an app, it does not open the app, but rather scrolls the screen, but when you tap the app, it starts...</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense.</p>

6035509,iptables with vlans and duplicate IPs,"<p>I'm setting up a test lab situation where multiple computers will have the same IP addresses, so they need vlan separation. For example, a group of virtual machines will have IPs 192.168.1.200, 192.168.1.201, etc. And another group of virtual machines will also have the same IPs.</p>

<p>I want to provide NAT mappings to each of the virtual machines so that each of them can be publicly accessible. I'm using Ubuntu 11.04 with iptables.  </p>

<p>Note: I'm normally a Windows admin, but Linux was the better solution here.</p>

<p>So basically I want the iptables NAT mapping to point to a specific interface and allow multiple duplicate IPs to co-exist.</p>

<p>Is this possible with a single Ubuntu device? I'm using virtual networking fabric so I don't have a physical network device in-between all of these.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram to represent it:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/RhSgH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>My NAT rules may be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -d 72.73.74.75 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.200 -o eth1.5
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.200 -j SNAT --to-source 72.73.74.75 -i eth1.5
</code></pre>

<p>It's the -i and -o that seem to only work with the public NIC so that's the part that I couldn't quite get working.  For example, using -i in the POSTROUTING (SNAT) gives this error: Can't use -i with POSTROUTING.  -o does the same with DNAT.</p>

6035510,How do I get /dev/random to work on an Ubuntu virtual machine?,"<p>Apparently, /dev/random is based on hardware interrupts or similar unpredictable aspects of physical hardware. Since virtual machines don't have physical hardware, running <code>cat /dev/random</code> within a virtual machine produces nothing. I'm using Ubuntu Server 11.04 as the host and guest, with libvirt/KVM.</p>

<p>I need to set-up Kerberos inside a VM, but <code>krb5_newrealm</code> just hangs forever ""Loading random data"", since the system isn't producing any.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to work around this? Is is possible to pass the host's /dev/random (which is very chatty) into the vm so the vm can use it's random data?</p>

<p>I've read that there are some software alternatives, but they aren't good for cryptology since they aren't random enough.</p>

<p>EDIT: It appears that cat /dev/random on the vm does produce output, just very, very slowly. I got my realm set-up by waiting about two hours while it was ""Loading random data"". Eventually it got enough to continue. I'm still interested in a way to accelerate this though.</p>

    }
}

<p>Now, the fade out is set to run slower than the fade in. I want the user to see it fade out slowly so they know it's on purpose, and then fade back in quickly if the elements are needed (removing some clutter from the screen when it's not needed).</p>

<p>fade(true) works fine, fade(false) works fine and is faster. My problem occurs when I call fade(true) followed shortly by fade(false). The fades fight with each other and then, since the fade(true) call runs faster it finishes first and the fade(false) call proceeds to fade it all out fully.</p>

<p>My question is: what can I do to make the fade(false) call cancel the loop of the fade(true) call?</p>

6035520,how to move an inside container beyond its outside container?,"<p><strong>Edit 1</strong></p>

<p>Have updated with a jsfiddle link. <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/DrFSV/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/DrFSV/</a></p>

<p>See the wavy image in the last row? I'm trying to get that move outside of #outer_middle. </p>

<p>Advice?</p>

<p>This pertains to the original link. Have removed site's link. </p>

<p>I have a div container named #outer_middle, and inside that, I have two other containers named #middle and #sidebar. </p>

<p>I am trying to have a div inside #middle go a bit outside the container ... </p>

<p>So, I put position:relative to #outer_middle, and position:absolute to #diy (the one with black border) coupled with left:-90px;</p>

<p>(as per my understanding that if you're trying to get an inside container move outside of its outside container, you need to put relative and absolute positioning like this). </p>

<p>It affects the sidebar (pink column) and that goes underneath #middle and the diy image goes to the left <em>inside the container</em>, not outside. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>How can I get the #diy move to the left outside of the container? </p>

<p>And is it possible to do this so #diy remains in the flow as well? </p>

<p>Now the problem is the issue with this approach is that if in java project named TESTRESULT there are 3 packages and each package having 2 files each then in the result on console it shows file name followed by loc of only the latest package only lets say in a java projest 3 packages named abc, def and tyu</p>

<pre><code>com.abc package having files ---&gt;abc.java
com.def package having files ---&gt;abc.java
com.tyu package having files ---&gt;FileBrowse.java , FileCountLine.java

the outcome shown in console is... 


    Directory: C:\Users\vaio\Desktop\Demo\TESTRESULT\.settings
    Directory: C:\Users\vaio\Desktop\Demo\TESTRESULT\bin
    Directory: C:\Users\vaio\Desktop\Demo\TESTRESULT\src
    Directory: C:\Users\vaio\Desktop\Demo\TESTRESULT\src\com
    Directory: C:\Users\vaio\Desktop\Demo\TESTRESULT\src\com\abc

    SUM OF ALL THE LINES ==&gt; 296
</code></pre>

<p>which is not perfect. please advise HOW IT WILL SHOW FILENAME FOLLOWED BY LOC for all the files</p>

<p>What I think is In the method that reads the files and the line count, you create a NEW Map for each directory and re-assign it to the same result. Since you do not display the data before you re-assign the Map, the previous Map is no longer accessible and by the time you get to the display you only have a Map for the last directory. Instead, you should maintain a single Map and insert new values from each directory into the same Map. </p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {  
            //...  
            for (File file : files) {  
                System.out.println(""Directory: ""+file);  
                result = getFileLineCount(file);
</code></pre>

<p>Right there you get a Map back from <code>getFileLineCount()</code>, and assign it to result. This discards the previously created result Map, and you lose everything that was already there. You have a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass the result Map into the <code>getFileLineCount()</code> method so you can add results to the one Map, rather than creating a new Map for each folder inside the <code>getFileLineCount()</code> method</li>
<li>Take the results from <code>getLineCount()</code> and copy them into the result Map rather than replacing the result Map</li>
<li>Create another collection, like a Map like: <code>Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt;</code> (which would map the results returned by the <code>getFileLineCount()</code> method to the name of the directory those results pertain to), or <code>List&lt;Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt;</code> (which would be a simple list of the results returned by <code>getFileLineCount()</code> without any mapping to the parent directory).</li>
</ol>

<p>Please advise how to refactor my code ,Thanks in advance  </p>

6035544,"How to build a multi-taxonomy, multi-term query based on user input","<p>Thanks to <a href=""http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/2232/otto"">Otto</a>'s excellent post on <a href=""http://ottopress.com/2010/wordpress-3-1-advanced-taxonomy-queries/"" rel=""nofollow"">advanced taxonomy queries</a>, I (mostly) understand how to create multi-taxonomy and multi-term queries. However, what I don't know is how to build those dynamically based on user input. I'd really like to end up with something like Amazon.com has on their site, with check boxes next to the various terms for a taxonomy in the sidebar (and multiple lists of terms, each with a taxonomy heading). Something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PkYVW.png"" alt=""Taxonomy with list of terms and check boxes to select those terms""></p>

<p>How should I go about building something like this? Displaying the content dynamically (content changes when a box is checked) would be great, but I'd certainly settle for having a ""submit"" button.</p>

6035545,Read hex text format 0x from stream,"<p>I'm looking for a simple method to read a hex value from a text file using streams.  I searched Stack Overflow using ""C++ hex read stream 0x"" and most of responses were about writing hex as text or reading in hex values without the ""0x"" prefix.

6035546,API Design Question,"<p>I am currently designing a API and have come to a slight design issue and was hoping for a few other opinions.  My url structure for accessing basic data from the API is: /clientName/appName/methodName/.  Basically each client may have a different set of methods for each application, so the base application class is extended through each client if the file exists.  My question is with limiting the data pulled back through a GET request.  Should the limiting number be appended to the URL or is that something that should be handled through POST request only?  Should it even be a option? Looking for best practices in this scenario, thanks.</p>

6035557,Trouble Writing SQL Query,"<p>I'm having trouble writing a query.  I have a support tabled called 'MYTABLE' and it has a column called 'TABLENAME' that can have one or many table names in it.  Multiple Tables are separated with commas.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>TBLUSER
TBLUSER, TBLACCOUNT
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to write an query that will identify any entries in the MYTABLE table that are not valid tables in the database.  I was able to write the follow....</p>

<pre><code>                     SELECT *
                       FROM MYTABLE T1
            LEFT outer JOIN ALL_TAB_COLS T2

6035569,Is there an analytic solution for the density function of this complex random variable?,"<p>The process below yields a distribution of ""response times"" (RT), and I'd like to know if there is an analytic solution to obtain the density function of this distribution.</p>

<p>An RT is recorded at the earliest time ($t_1$) at which a function, $f(t)$, reaches a threshold.</p>

<p>The threshold varies across iterations of the process according to a random uniform distribution with bounds specified by the parameters $P_1$ and $P_2$.</p>

<p>$f(t)$ begins at $t=0$ and has a form whose derivative is defined by the function $g(t)$:</p>

<p>$$g(t) = P_3\left (\frac{P_4}{P_4+P_5}\right )\left (1-\exp\left [-(P_4+P_5)\int_{0}^{t}h(s)ds\right ]\right )$$</p>

<p>where $h(t)$ is defined as:</p>

<p>$$h(t) = P_6\Gamma(t,P_8,n)[1 - \Gamma(t-P_7,P_9,n)]$$</p>

<p>and the gamma function defined as:</p>

<p>$$\Gamma(t,\beta,n) = 1- \left ( e^{-\beta t} \right )\left ( \sum_{n-1}^{j=0} \frac{(\beta t)^{j}}{j!}  \right )$$</p>

<p>So, there are in total 10 parameters in the process: $P_1$ through $P_9$, and $n$. I could of course perform a Euler simulation to generate a distribution of RT values for given a particular set of 10 parameter values, but it would be nice to avoid this because I'm hoping to use a Nelder–Mead search algorithm to find the set of 10 parameter values that maximizes the likelihood of a set of observed RT data points, and it really slows down the search if I have to compute estimates of the density function for every candidate set of parameter values.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you're able to provide!</p>

<p>Pursuant to comments, here is a further description of the process:</p>

<p>The process is an adaptation of the model presented by <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0015156"" rel=""nofollow"">Smith &amp; Racliff</a> (<a href=""http://star.psy.ohio-state.edu/coglab/People/roger/pdf/psychrev09b.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF</a>) which models perception, attention and decision in the context of a speeded detection task. Function $h(t)$ models perception: accumulation of information about a brief visual stimulus. Function $g(t)$ models the transfer of this information to memory via attention, and function $h(t)$ is a linear ballistic decision process in the vein of <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002"" rel=""nofollow"">Brown &amp; Heathcote</a> (<a href=""http://psychology.stanford.edu/~jlm/pdfs/BrownHeathcote08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDF</a>). I thought that supplementing an LBA as the decision mechanism in place of Smith &amp; Ratcliff's diffusion process might simplify the derivation of the final density function.</p>

<p>$P_1$ and $P_2$ are the upper and lower bounds of the random uniform threshold.
$P_3$ is the asymptote of $g(t)$.
$P_4$ is the intensity of the stimulus.
$P_5$ is the intensity of the background.
$P_6$ is the amplitude of the stimulus.
$P_7$ is the duration of the stimulus.
$P_8$ is the rate at which the stimulus comes on.
$P_9$ is the rate at which the stimulus turns off.</p>

<p>Smith &amp; Ratcliff (2009) note that $n$ might be reasonably fixed to a value of 3, so possibly that can further simplify things. Additionally, while Smith &amp; Ratcliff sought to fit their model to different stimulus intensities, I don't need this particular feature, so I'm not sure if I need parameters $P_4$ and $P_5$ (though I'm not sure how to properly remove them either).</p>

However, it is not very practical, since when I change my JNI based java code, I can simply create a new jar, but to connect that jar to my actual plugin, I have to re-create the jar wrapper plugin every time. 
That is, I delete the jar wrapper plugin project, with everything on the disk, and re create it with the same name, pointing to the updated jar. I also have to drop the reference to this project from the actual plugin project and add again (maybe this has gotten smarter recently, but I did not test it)</p>

<p>This is time consuming, and I can't add this wrapper plugin project to svn either, since it is being created from scratch every time. </p>

<p>If I could simply update a jar wrapping eclipse plugin project by pointing at the new version of jar, that would solve my problem, and I could commit the project to svn after each update. </p>

<p>Is there any method you can think of which may help me run this process smoothly?</p>

6035580,Big bitmap not always created,"<p>everybody!</p>

<p>I draw a plot based on some data in my app. The plot is with scrolling and zooming. I create 2 bitmaps for this purpose in MyMainFragment.onActivityCreated().</p>

<pre><code>if (bitmaps[0] != null)
      {
         return;
      }    

final int deviceWidth = getResources().getDisplayMetrics().widthPixels;
          final int deviceHeight = getResources().getDisplayMetrics().heightPixels;
          final int deviceMaxDim = Math.max(deviceHeight, deviceWidth);

          bitmaps[0] = Bitmap.createBitmap(
             deviceMaxDim * 2,
             deviceMaxDim * 1,

           bitmaps[0].getHeight(),
           bitmaps[0].getConfig());
</code></pre>

<p>I need 2 bitmaps and not only 1 because of the drawing algorithm I use. Running the program on Asus Transformer, the bmp size in pixels is 1280 * 2 * 1280, thus the byte size being 1280 * 2 * 1280 * 4. When I run the program from Eclipse, everything's fine. But when I launch it like an ordinary user from the tablet, it crashes every second time.</p>

<p>What's happening behind the scene when I launch my app from Eclipse that allows it to run and can I follow the same steps programmatically so that it doesn't crash when launched normally? Or should I use some other drawing algorithms (maybe something like OpenGL)?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

6035601,JavaScript Performance Long Running Tasks,"<p>I noticed a question on here the other day ( <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6846681/reducing-javascript-cpu-usage"">Reducing Javascript CPU Usage</a> ) and I was intrigued. </p>

<p>Essentially the guy wanted to encrypt some files character by character. Obviously doing all this in one go is going to lock up the browser. </p>

<p>His first idea was to do it in chunks roughly 1kb's worth of string at a time, then pause for X ms so it would allow the user to keep interacting with the page between processing. He also considered using webWorkers ( the best idea ), but it obviously isn't cross browser.</p>

<p>Now I don't really want to go into why this probably isn't a good idea in javascript. But I wanted to see if I could come up with a solution.</p>

<p>I remembered watching a video by Douglas Crockford <a href=""http://blip.tv/jsconfeu/douglas-crockford-loopage-4384069"">at js conf</a>. The video was related to node.js and the event loop. But I remembered him talking about breaking long running functions down into individual chunks, so the newly called function goes to the end of the event loop. Instead of clogging the event loop up with a long running task, preventing anything else from happening. </p>

<p>I knew this was a solution worthy of my investigation. As a front-end Developer I have never really experienced extremely long running tasks in JS and was keen to find out about how to break them up and how they perform.</p>

<p>I decided to try a recursive function out, which calls itself from inside a setTimeout of 0ms. I figured that this would provide the breaks in the event loop for anything else that wanted to happen while it was running. But I also figured that while there is nothing else going on you will get maximum computation. </p>

<p>Here is what I came up with.</p>

<p>(I'm going to apologise for the code. I was experimenting in the console so this was quick and dirty.)</p>

<pre><code>function test(i, ar, callback, start){

        setTimeout(function(){
            test( i, ar, callback, start);

    }
    else {
        callback(ar, start);
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>( You can paste this code into the console and it will work )</p>

<p>Essentially what the function does is takes a number, creates an array and calls itself while the <code>array.length &lt; number</code> pushing the count so far into the array. It passes the array created in the first call to all subsequent calls.</p>

<p>I tested it out and it seems to work exactly as intended. Only it's performance is fairly poor. I tested it out with..</p>

<p>( again this is not sexy code ) </p>

<pre><code>test(5000, undefined, function(ar, start ){ 
    var finish = new Date; 
    console.log(
        ar.length,
        'timeTaken: ', finish - start 
    ); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now I obviously wanted to know how long it took to complete, the above code took around 20s. Now it seems to me that it should not take 20s for JS to count to 5000. Add in the fact that it is doing some calculation and processing to push items into the array. But still 20s is a bit steep. </p>

<p>So I decided to spawn several at the same time to see how that effected the browser performance and calculation speeds. </p>

<p>( the code isn't getting any sexier )</p>

<pre><code>function foo(){ 
test(5000, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 1'  ) });
test(5000, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 2'  ) });
test(5000, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 3'  ) });
test(5000, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 4'  ) });
test(5000, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 5'  ) });
};
</code></pre>

<p>So that's five in total, running at the same time and not causing any hanging of the browser.</p>

<p>after the process's ended the all results returned at virtually exactly the same time. it took around 21.5s for all of them to complete. That's just 1.5s slower than one on it's own. But I was moving my mouse around the window on elements that had <code>:hover</code> effects just to make sure that the browser was still responding, so that might account for some of the 1.5s  overhead.</p>

<p>So as these functions are obviously running in parallel there is more computational juice left in the browser.</p>

<p><strong>Is anyone able to explain what's going on here performance wise, and give details on how to improve functions like this?</strong></p>

<p>Just to go crazy I did this..</p>

<pre><code>function foo(){
    var count = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000;  
    test(count, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 1'  ) });
    test(count, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 2'  ) });
    test(count, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 3'  ) });
    test(count, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 4'  ) });
    test(count, undefined, function(ar, start ){ var finish = new Date; console.log(ar.length, 'timeTaken: ', finish - start, 'issue: 5'  ) });
};
</code></pre>

<p>It's been running the whole time I have been writing this post, and is still going for it. The browser is not complaining or hanging. I will add the completion time once it ends. </p>

6035609,Domain migration results in MS Office running installer every time,"<p>My workplace is migrating multiple departments, each with their own AD domain into one combined one. For the most part this is all ok, however we've run into a problem with MS Office 2003 installs on Windows XP (perhaps would affect users on Windows 7 with Office 2010, but yet to try them).</p>

<p>After migrating users, when they try and open any MS Office files, they get a Windows Installer running saying that ""the feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable"" and to point it to another network location. The server that it <em>was</em> on is of course now gone...</p>

<p>The first thing we tried was to update from Office 2003 to Office 2010 which was available over the network in Add/Remove Programs. For any other users of the machine aside from the migrated user, this worked fine, but the migrated user still got the same installer prompt when opening existing files even though Office had upgraded. Launching directly was all ok.</p>

<p>I've done some searching and came across this previous question: <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/48503/how-can-one-fix-the-pesky-windows-of-windows-installer-which-pops-up-every-tim"">How can one fix the Pesky windows of &quot;Windows installer&quot; which pops up every time</a> which indicates that install on first use or run from network is the problem.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I get around this? Any way to disable this and configure to run all from my computer <em>before</em> the migration takes place? I never saw options to run all from my computer during the network install of Office 2010 and would have expected that this, coming from a new network location, would have resolved it.</p>

tet_for_face{1,2,3} = 1;
tet_for_face{1,2,4} = 1;
tet_for_face{1,3,4} = 1;
tet_for_face{2,3,4} = 1;

<pre><code>tet_for_face{2,3,3}

tet_for_face{2,3,4}
ans = 1

tet2 = cellfun(@(x) cell(num_nodes, 1), tet, 'UniformOutput', 0);
tet3 = cellfun(@(x) cellfun(@(y) cell(num_nodes, 1), x, 'UniformOutput', 0), tet2, 'UniformOutput', 0);

tet3{2}{3}{4} = 1;
...

<p>Although this works for small meshes, and doesn't require contiguous memory (AFAIK), it  has a nasty habit of crashing MATLAB with N=1000. </p>

Exception Codes: SEGV_ACCERR
</code></pre>

<p>The crash is happening on the line that does <code>numberOfFails++</code>.</p>

<p>The app uses <code>ASIHTTP</code>. I personally much prefer using <code>NSURLConnection</code>. I'd never automatically repeat a request for <code>NSURLConnection</code> if it failed because I've never seen it fail when it shouldn't. I'd rather just give the UI a refresh button or show a <code>UIAlertView</code> with a button to try again or something like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, to cooperate with other team members, I'm looking to fix this issue without replacing <code>ASIHTTP</code> with <code>NSURLConnection</code> for now.</p>

<p>The request is being started with something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)getResources:(CLLocation *)location withQuery:(NSString *)query {
    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithString:@""https://example.com/""]];

    resourcesAPIRequest.userInfo = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:NSStringFromSelector(@selector(getResources:withQuery:)), @""repeatSelector"", location, @""argument1"", query, @""argument2"", nil];   
    [resourcesAPIRequest startAsynchronous];
}
</code></pre>

<p>One thing I noticed is <code>: &lt;ASIHTTPRequestDelegate&gt;</code> is not in the header file, but this callback method is still being called OK:</p>

<pre><code>#define maximumNumberOfFails 50

- (void)requestFailed:(ASIFormDataRequest *)request {

    if (numberOfFails &lt; maximumNumberOfFails) {

        if ([request.userInfo objectForKey:@""argument2""]) {
            [self performSelector:NSSelectorFromString([request.userInfo objectForKey:@""repeatSelector""]) withObject:[request.userInfo objectForKey:@""argument1""] withObject:[request.userInfo objectForKey:@""argument2""]];
        } else if ([request.userInfo objectForKey:@""argument1""]) {
            [self performSelector:NSSelectorFromString([request.userInfo objectForKey:@""repeatSelector""]) withObject:[request.userInfo objectForKey:@""argument1""]];
        } else {
            [self performSelector:NSSelectorFromString([request.userInfo objectForKey:@""repeatSelector""])];
        }
        numberOfFails++;
    } else {

        [alert show];
        [alert release];
        numberOfFails = 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I think that <code>static int numberOfFails</code> should be <code>static NSUInteger numberOfFails</code>. And, I noticed that the request is started with <code>startAsynchronous</code>. Is <code>static int numberOfFails</code> atomic? That may be why we're getting the error <code>SEGV_ACCERR</code> (Invalid permissions for mapped object).</p>

<p>I have used <strong>Advanced Custom Fields</strong> to create a field called product_thumbnail
I have used <strong>Additional Image Sizes</strong> to create a new image size called products
I have used the following code on another word press site and it worked fine, but on my current site it returns empty.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $image = wp_get_attachment_image_src(get_field('product_thumbnail'), 'products'); ?&gt;
&lt;a href=""&lt;?php the_permalink(); ?&gt;""&gt;&lt;img src=""&lt;?php echo $image[0]; ?&gt;"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<p>I have ran a batch to make sure my images are created if not already.
This is boggling my mind. Any help appreciated.</p>
"
6035623,Discerning The Set Of Values For A Random Variable,"<p>The question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each random variable defined here, describe the set of
  possible values for the variable, and state whether the variable is discrete.</p>
  
  <p>a. $X=$the number of unbroken eggs in a randomly chosen standard egg carton</p>
  
  <p>b. $Y=$ the number of students on a class list for a particular course who are absent on the first day of classes</p>
  
  <p>c.$U=$ the number of times a duffer has to swing at a golf ball before hitting it</p>
  
  <p>d. $X=$ the length of a randomly selected rattlesnake</p>
  
  <p>e. $Z=$ the amount of royalties earned from the sale of a first
  edition of 10,000 textbooks</p>
  
  <p>f.$Y=$ the pH of a randomly chosen soil sample</p>
  
  <p>g. $X=$ the tension (psi) at which a randomly selected tennis
  racket has been strung</p>
  
  <p>h. $X=$ the total number of coin tosses required for three
  individuals to obtain a match (HHH or TTT)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some odd reason, the answer key doesn't provide answers to every part.</p>

<p>For parts d) f), and g), I know that the random variable is continuous, but how would I represent the set of possible values in set builder notation? I could write it only in intervalic notation.</p>

<p>For parts b), c), and h), the random variables are discrete, but would it be countably infinite?</p>

<p>As for part e), the answer key says that it is discrete, but I feel it could be continuous. What if each textbook was valued at $50 \pi$?</p>

                 .CreateInterfaceProxyWithTarget(IA, new Interceptor());
  proxy.foo();

}
</code></pre>

<p>I would have expected the output:</p>

<pre><code>Intercepted foo
foo
Intercepted bar
bar
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, I get:</p>

<pre><code>Intercepted foo
foo
bar
</code></pre>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>How does the dynamic proxy work? 
I was expecting the generated proxy to <em>inherit</em> from the proxied class, however, it seems that it uses <em>composition</em> to delegate each of the methods in the proxied interface to the actual implementation. </p>

<p>I've tried with Castle DynamicProxy and also with an older dynamic proxy implementation, from <a href=""http://www.cramon.dk/dynamicproxy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Cramon</a></p>

6035626,iPad Question: Is there an alternative to modally presenting a view?,"<p>For the fullscreen imaging app I am doing for iPad. I want to present an informational view atop the current view. This is simply a view, centered on but not entirely occluding the display that presents a textual description. This is the sort of thing we see routinely on websites where clicking on a link presents a canvas with a little ""X"" at one of the corners to dismiss. I want to replicate this on iPad. I prefer not to use a modally presented view. The sliding up/down thing is not really appropriate and a bit distracting/dramatic here. Could someone suggest an approach?</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>What I am currently thinking of doing is something super simple. Hide the view I intend to present behind the view it is intended to occlude. Then bring-to-front and perhaps animate in the opacity for a bit of slickness. What do folks think?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Doug</p>

6035627,Execute code before splash screen,"<p>I have a VB.NET application with <code>Enable application framework</code> checked, and <code>Splash screen</code> set. At the same time, I need to run some code before the splash screen is loaded. <code>MyApplication_Startup</code> seems to go later, so it's not suitable. I understand it's possible with custom splash screen, but would prefer any other way to make it without more complex customization.</p>

<p>EDIT: Apparently, the issue is different. Code that runs before the splash-screen is thread-specific. It doesn't take proper effect, since splash screen is on another thread.</p>

<p>The problem is with TrayPopup. This I would like to show the values of all Orders in my OrderCollecion in a listview/listBox. I hope my question is understandable and that my code isn't too messy. I can make it work when I fill a listbox with a XmlDataProvider, but not with a ObjectdataProvider or directly from a collection.</p>

6035631,whats the best way to show a partialview on the results of a jquery json call,"<p>i have an asp.net mvc view where the top of the page is a table.  What i want is to click on a row in the table which will go to the server and get back details on that table.  This is working fine and i am returning the details in Json.  </p>

<p>The issue is i know want to show a details panel below.  Right now i have the details pane all complete in a partial view.</p>

<p>How would i ""hook this up"" using jquery so when i click on the row, the details pane shows up with the correct model data filled out.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do i ditch the json and simply generate html in my controller action and return html to the view to display the details pane ?</li>
<li>Other best practices or suggestions here ?</li>

6035636,jQuery Children vs Sibling(s) with $(this) as the selector parent element,"<p>Ok, I suspect there will be dozens of these on my page so I am trying to build a single function to handle them properly without having to recycle code over and over and changing the IDs or class names of elements just to make this work.</p>

<p>My HTML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""button_select""&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""button_select_toggle""&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;div class=""button_select_text""&gt;Menu Text&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""button_select_arrow""&gt;V&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;ul class=""button_select_sub"" rel=""hidden""&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Text&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Text&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Text&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Text&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And what I am trying to do currently is get specifically the UL with the class button_select_sub so I can get its rel value. Which yes to some extent this would be easy if this was going to be the only one on any given page, however this is going to be on any given page who knows how many times. Hence me trying to make the universal function for handling them. Anyway my last failed attempt was:</p>

<pre><code>var selectstatus = $(this).siblings('.button_select_sub').attr('rel');
alert('status: '+selectstatus);
</code></pre>

<p>but in the alert I am getting ""status: undefined"" maybe im not using siblings correctly? maybe theres an alternative option. Also worth mentioning is button_select_sub might not always be the last UL in the div so I can't do :last either.</p>

<p>ive also tried, children().find().. and a couple others, I know its possible I just can't chain it together right.</p>

6035639,Can I simulate a click on a hyperlink with JQuery code?,"<p>I have seen a couple of SO posts which apparently relate to my question but none of them seem to do what I want.</p>

    &lt;td&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;

...
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class='BrandRow1 StoreRow2'&gt;
...
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and within this layout I use <code>A</code> tags to show/hide the 'child' content (by making use of the <code>class</code> attributes.</p>

<p>On load, I want to show all the 'nodes' if  <code>$('.StoreRow2').length</code> is less than say 4.</p>

<p>I use a function to do the toggling:</p>

<pre><code>// Allow an item to toggle other items' visibility
$("".VisibilityToggle"").click(function () {
    var ControlledClass = findClass($(this), ""Toggles-"");
    if (ControlledClass != """") {
        $(""."" + ControlledClass).toggle();
        var Text = $(this).attr(""rel"");
        if (Text != """") $(this).attr(""rel"", $(this).attr(""rev"")).attr(""rev"", Text).text(Text);
    }
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>and what I'd like to do is trigger the 'toggling' open by calling this from JS code.</p>

<p>I thought something like '$("".VisibilityToggle"").click()` would do what I want but this doesn't seem to work in my code, but <strong>does</strong> if I call it manually via the JS console in Chrome. I suspect its to do with my code running before the events have been bound to the page.</p>

6035641,Help me write a binary search for boundary values (extracting sub lists),"<p>Let's say I have an array of lots of values (C++ syntax, sorry):</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;double&gt; x(100000);
</code></pre>

<p>This array is sorted such that <code>x[n] &gt; x[n-1]</code>.</p>

<p>I would like a function to retrieve an array of all values in the range [a, b] (that's inclusive). Some interface like:</p>

<pre><code>void subarray(const double a, const double b, vector&lt;double&gt; &amp;sub) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>When this function completes, <code>sub</code> will contain the <code>n</code> values that fell in the range [a, b].</p>

<p>Of course a linear search is easy:</p>

<pre><code>void subarray(const double a, const double b, vector&lt;double&gt; &amp;sub) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; data.size(); i++) {
        if (a &lt;= data[i] &amp;&amp; data[i] &lt;= b) {
            sub.push_back(data[i]);
        }
    }
}

<p>However, because <code>data</code> is sorted, I should be able to do this much faster using a binary search. Who wants to take a stab at it? Any language is permitted!</p>

6035647,DATEDIFF() or BETWEEN for Date Ranges in SQL Queries,"<p>I have recently been informed that the use of the <code>BETWEEN</code> method in SQL is somewhat unreliable, and I should therefore be using <code>DATEDIFF()</code>. However, another programmer has informed me this is not the case and the <code>BETWEEN</code> method works brilliantly in all cases as long as the date is formatted correctly.</p>

<p>Please could someone settle this debate by stating which method is better and why?</p>

<p>At the moment my date range SQL looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DATEDIFF(d,'01-Jan-1970',SIH.[Something_Date]) &gt;= 0 AND DATEDIFF(d,'01-Jan-2013',SIH.[Something_Date]) &lt;= 0

6035650,How to give a timeout to an FTP connection,"<p><em><strong>The story behind:</em></strong></p>

<p>Old script written in ruby 1.8.6 that opens a connection to a ftp and download a configuration file. For a specific client with a windows ftp server the script just hangs. The log stops writing after it opens the connection to the ftp.
It's an old script, it's in ruby and I'm not an expert on it.</p>

<p><em><strong>What I tried:</em></strong></p>

<p>So I tried this implementation of a timeout to check if an ftp connection hangs out with this code</p>

<pre><code>Timeout::timeout(5) {
ftp = Net::FTP.new(host,pass,host)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this isn't working. My guess is that the interpreter stops on opening the connection and the timeout doesn't kill the connection because the interpreter is stuck.</p>

<p>Is it possible that that's the problem?</p>

<p>Could you tell me if there is maybe an alternative solution or if I'm doing something wrong?</p>

<p><em><strong>More information about it:</em></strong></p>

<p>This problem happens like once in a while during a month. Like at most twice. The client sent us the ftp server logs but nothing seems wrong on that side. It's just that the FTP hangs there for no reason at all...</p>

<p>So a Promotion has_many Sweepstake through join table PromotionSweepstake. This is a legacy db schema so the naming might seem a bit odd and there are some self.table_name == and foreign_key stuff left out.</p>

<p>The nature of this app <strong>demands</strong> that at least one entry in the join table is present for a promotionId, because not having a sweepstake would break the app.</p>

<h2>First question</h2>

<p>How can I guarantee that there is always one entry in PromotionSweepstake for a Promotion? At least one Sweepstake.id has to be included upon creation, and once an entry in the join table is created there <strong>has to be a minimum of one for each Promotion/promotion_id</strong>.</p>

<h2>Second question (other option)</h2>

<p>If the previous suggestion would not be possible, which I doubt is true, there's another way the problem can be worked around. There's a sort of ""default Sweepstake"" with a certain id. If through a form all the sweepstake_ids would be removed (so that all entries for the Promotion in the join table would be deleted), can I create a new entry in PromotionSweepstake?</p>

<h3>pseudo_code (sort of)</h3>

<p>delete promotion_sweepstake with ids [1, 4, 5] where promotion_id = 1

6035656,How to use replication in combination with version control system?,"<p>The situation is as follow :</p>

<p>Our company works two main production sites, communicating via <strong>WAN</strong>. We develop a software internally which uses about <strong>100Gb of disk space</strong> on our servers (application data deployed to our customers with a lot of images). In order in improve performance, our network administrators choosed DFS replication (every 6 hours). This means that our users (people from within the company) do not have to wait (sometimes 2-3 hours) to download the needed files, because they are available locally (over LAN).</p>

<p>The problem is that the algorithm used by <strong>DFS replication is ""Last Writer Wins""</strong>. So, in case of simultaneous changes (during development/maintenance), the file with the latest date will win. I would like to avoid such <strong>data loss</strong>.</p>

<p>I am project manager for the overall develop process. What I want to do, is to introduce people to version control systems to tackle the simultaneous modifications problem. I plan to use Mercurial for several reasons, mainly because it is distributed, simple to explain, usable for personal use, free, and (most importantly) has great <strong>merging capabilities</strong>. However the benefits of the version control system when used locally (LAN) is lost because of the replication process (WAN) which doesn't know how to merge.</p>

<p>Some possible solutions are to :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>use only version control over the WAN (hoping that compression will be enough to speed things up)</p></li>
<li><p>use only DFS, and track changes manually (error-prone)</p></li>
<li><p>find a work-around with both methods</p></li>

6035664,Why does my jQuery UI range slider not respond to pubsub events?,"<p>I am creating a calculator based on the jQuery UI range slider and have a setup that works. I have a bindEvents function in my application that binds the slider to the <code>slide</code> event:</p>

<pre><code>    // this is where I bind all slide events
    bindEvents: function() {
        // hold on to the value of this
        var self = CloudCalc;

        // bind the slider's slide event to a data event
        self.sl.on('slide', this.setSliderOutputValue);             
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and then here is the handler that faithfully executes my event:</p>

<pre><code>setSliderOutputValue: function (event, ui) {
        // hold on to the value of this
        var self = CloudCalc;

        // show the ui output value on slide event
        self.output.html( ui.value + "" INSTANCE"");  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to trigger multiple events when the user slides the slider. So I would like to use the observer pattern in this setup like so (using addyosmani's pubsub plugin):</p>

<pre><code>bindEvents: function() {
    // hold on to the value of this
    var self = CloudCalc;

    // bind the slider's slide event and publish it
    self.sl.on('slide', $.publish('slider/moved'));             
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the subscription:</p>

<pre><code>subscriptions: function () {
    $.subscribe('slider/moved', this.setSliderOutputValue);     
}
</code></pre>

<p>So when this subscription calls the <code>setSliderOutputValue</code> event, I get a console error saying:</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined
</code></pre>

<p>That means the reference to ui property is not getting passed to the <code>setSliderOutputValue</code> event. </p>

<p>How do I pass the ui property? Please correct me if I am doing this wrong.</p>

<p>Please take a note that the last two lines from my input text file are to be dinged in my final output sql file. Its kind of automating the xls macro I am manually doing now by dos scripting where the 'insert into xyz.abcd values' is considered to be a constant string which is written to each new line before the actual date and filename from the file been read.
I will name my final output file as a .sql and execute it remotely from my computer.
Can somebody please help me if this can be doable in DOS programming or not.</p>

<p>I have tried to present a similar problem in another post which I am trying to delete, but am unable to do so. Guess I didnt explain the other one properly.</p>

<p>I know I can redirect the string as a literal to a file by the echo command but the challenge is how do I read fraction of a line from one file and put them into a new file.</p>

6035679,What stupid error on my part is causing my c# WinForms application to freeze / hang?,"<p>I have a .Net 2.0 C# WinForms application that runs fine in development but occasionally freezes in production. I have looked for all the usual culprits:<br>
1. I've used InvokeRequired and Invoke to make sure that no UI components are manipulated from the wrong thread.<br>
2. I've synchronized all my timer objects on the UI thread.<br>
3. I've read this article <a href=""http://www.ikriv.com/en/prog/info/dotnet/MysteriousHang.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikriv.com/en/prog/info/dotnet/MysteriousHang.html</a> about OnUserPreferenceChanged and I did have this problem, but I fixed it.</p>

<p>This started happening when we migrated from .Net 1.1 to .Net 2+. Before that, it never hang.</p>

<p>I'm using Managed Stack Explorer to periodically get stack traces from the production application when this problem occurs and the main UI thread is always stuck in some new random place. It's not blocked on WaitOne as you might expect if this were a thread deadlock.</p>

<p>My application does these things:<br>
- Uses multiple System.Timers.Timer instances.<br>
- Uses WMI to manage printing.<br>
- Has a few background threads that make Web Services calls to a server, but do not interact with the UI.<br>
- Has a few background thread that use System.Diagnostics.Process to look at other processes on the computer and sometimes kill them.<br>
- Interacts with a 3rd party dll that uses the serial port to talk to a bill acceptor.<br>
- Interacts with some com/activex/ocx controls to interact with a credit card reader.  </p>

<p>Here's an example of one time it hang and all the stack traces at the time:</p>

6035680,How do you use event handlers with parameters?,"<p>I'm trying to sort out how the events work. In video 4 of the Stanford course on iTunes U, Alan Cannistraro says there are</p>

<p>""3 different flavors of action method selector types
- (void)actionMethod;
- (void)actionMethod:(id)sender;
- (void)actionMethod:(id)sender withEvent:(UIEvent *)event;""</p>

<p>I thought I'd try them out with a simple adding program - you enter 2 numbers and as you type the sum gets places in a 3rd UITextField. I have a method with the no-parameter signature, and it works fine. When I change it to the second with the sender parameter, the code stops calling the method.</p>

<p>This works:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) setSum {
float a1 = addend1.text.floatValue;
float a2 = addend2.text.floatValue;
float thesum = a1 + a2;
NSString * ssum = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%g"", thesum]; 
sum.text = ssum;
}

-(void)awakeFromNib {
SEL setSumMethod = @selector(setSum);
[addend1 addTarget: self action: setSumMethod forControlEvents: UIControlEventEditingChanged];
[addend2 addTarget: self action: setSumMethod forControlEvents: UIControlEventEditingChanged];
}// awakeFromNib
</code></pre>

<p>This runs but setSum doesn't get called:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) setSum:(id) sender {
float a1 = addend1.text.floatValue;
float a2 = addend2.text.floatValue;
float thesum = a1 + a2;
NSString * ssum = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%g"", thesum]; 
sum.text = ssum;
}


-(void)awakeFromNib {
SEL setSumMethod = @selector(setSum:);
[addend1 addTarget: self action: setSumMethod forControlEvents: UIControlEventEditingChanged];
[addend2 addTarget: self action: setSumMethod forControlEvents: UIControlEventEditingChanged];
}// awakeFromNib
</code></pre>

<p>So, the question is when do the other event method types work? Only the first seems to apply.</p>

<p>TIA</p>

<p>I understand this works fine... the student fills in their details... but what if there are 1000 or unknown number of students?? how do we get to create new instances instead of manually creating in the main ""Student student2 = new Student();"" and so on...and also how do we get to add the instance of a Student into the instance of a Major that they belong to?</p>

6035692,Breaking an interface,"<p>What are the most important guidelines to follow if you need to break an interface in a .NET application?  How do these guidelines change before and after your application has been deployed?</p>

<p>I know there are other questions that debate when/where interfaces should be used, however I don't want to get into that. I just want to know some effective approaches to mitigating effects on the rest of your application when you need to do this.</p>

<p>If I am just adding new method/s to an interface, will only implementors need modification/recompile, while all clients continue to operate happily with no change required?</p>

<p>What about renaming methods and variables, is this ever going to break an interface?</p>

<p>One strong recommendation I've come across in the past is ""never break an interface"".  But doesn't this produce a messy design such as IDocument, IDocument2, IDocument3, IDocument4, IDocument5, IDocument6 etc, as seen in the mshtml COM library?</p>

<p>I tried putting textBox.DataBindings[0].WriteValue(); in the textBox.Leave event but that did nothing. And Ive researched it but haven't been able to find anyone with the same or even similar problem.

<p>I need some help for (c) and (d).</p>

<p>Here it is what I did in (a) and (b).</p>

<p>It is easy to see that $T$ is linear.</p>

<p>(a) For every $x=(x_n)_n \in \ell^1$ it is $ ||T(x)||_{1}^{2} =\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \lambda |x_n| \leq \lambda \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lambda |x_n|= \lambda ||x||_1^{2} &lt; + \infty$</p>

<p>so $T(x) \in \ell^1$ and $||T|| \leq \lambda$. Also it is $||T|| \geq \frac{||T(e_2)||_1}{||e_2||_1} = \lambda$. Thus we have that $||T||= \lambda$.</p>

<p>(b) Using induction we see that $ T^n(x)= (\lambda^n x_{n+1} , \lambda^n x_{n+2} , \cdots )$</p>

6035708,Justification for bidirectional relationship,"<p>I typically try and avoid bidirectional relationships at all costs.  Recently I've been trying to follow a more domain centric design philosophy and I'm looking for advice in the best way to solve a specific problem.</p>

<p>I am implementing a basic 2d grid.  There are 3 basic classes, Item, Tile (has a list of Items), and World (has a 2d array of Tiles).</p>

<p>I am struggling with where to put the move() method which moves an item from one tile to a neighboring tile.  My initial inclination would be to place the move method in the Item class since it is the item that is actually moving.</p>

<p>However, that would create a circular dependency.  In the past I always worked with dumb objects in which case the move() method was in a higher layer (some kind of WorldManager or MoveManager) which knows about both tiles and items. I'm interested in what proposals others might have that can avoid the circular dependency while maintaining the domain-centric philosophy.</p>

\usepackage{minted}

\newcommand{\dollarcom}{\mint{bash}/$#/}

\begin{document}

\dollarcom
\mint{bash}|$#|
\end{document}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rq19h.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Reading from the <code>pdflatex</code> output it seems like <code>$#</code> is taken as an illegal parameter number. In this case, how can I define a command with the same output of <code>\mint{bash}|$#|</code>?</p>

<p>Note: I absolutely do <em>not</em> want to use <code>\mint{bash}|$#|</code> in my text because the non-escaped <code>$</code> breaks code highlighting in Kile and after that half of my LaTeX source looks green as if in math mode.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I found a hack to make Kile recognize a command as a <code>\verb</code> command.
If you want to change the system's syntax highlightining open <code>/usr/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax/latex.xml</code>, if you want to add syntax highlighting only for your user open <code>~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax/latex.xml</code>.
If the latter does not exist create the missing directories and copy the system-wide file into it.</p>

<p>Now modify the chosen file.
In particular there is a section that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;!-- LaTeX command in text mode --&gt;
  &lt;context name=""ContrSeq"" attribute=""Keyword"" lineEndContext=""#pop""&gt;
    &lt;StringDetect String=""verb*"" attribute=""Keyword"" context=""Verb""/&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""(Verb|verb|lstinline)(?=[^a-zA-Z])"" attribute=""Keyword"" context=""Verb""/&gt;
    &lt;DetectChar char=""&amp;#xd7;"" attribute=""Bullet"" context=""#stay""/&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""[a-zA-Z@]+(\+?|\*{0,3})"" attribute=""Keyword"" context=""#pop""/&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""[^a-zA-Z]"" attribute=""Keyword"" context=""#pop"" /&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;
  &lt;context name=""ToEndOfLine"" attribute=""Normal Text"" lineEndContext=""#pop""&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Modify the line <code>&lt;RegExpr String=""(Verb...</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RegExpr String=""(Verb|verb|lstinline|mint|mint\{[a-zA-Z0-9=, ]+\})(?=[^a-zA-Z])"" attribute=""Keyword"" context=""Verb""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow kile to highlight <code>\mint|text|</code> or <code>\mint{some,options}|text|</code>
in the correct way.</p>

<p>To make Kile highlight also the <code>minted</code> environments check for the section that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;!-- filter the environment name and check the type --&gt;
  &lt;context name=""BeginEnvironment"" attribute=""Environment"" lineEndContext=""#stay""&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""(lstlisting|(B|L)?Verbatim)"" attribute=""Environment"" context=""VerbatimEnvParam""/&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""(verbatim|boxedverbatim)"" attribute=""Environment"" context=""VerbatimEnv""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And change the last line to:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;RegExpr String=""(verbatim|boxedverbatim|minted)"" attribute=""Environment"" context=""VerbatimEnv""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Look for the section:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;!-- parse verbatim text --&gt;
  &lt;context name=""Verbatim"" attribute=""Verbatim"" lineEndContext=""#stay""&gt;
    &lt;DetectChar char=""&amp;#xd7;"" attribute=""Bullet"" context=""#stay""/&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""\\end(?=\s*\{(verbatim|lstlisting|boxedverbatim|(B|L)?Verbatim)\*?\})"" attribute=""Structure""  context=""VerbFindEnd""/&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And change the <code>RegExpr</code> line with:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;RegExpr String=""\\end(?=\s*\{(verbatim|lstlisting|boxedverbatim|minted|(B|L)?Verbatim)\*?\})"" attribute=""Structure""  context=""VerbFindEnd""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Look for the section:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;!-- end of verbatim environment --&gt;
  &lt;context name=""VerbFindEnd"" attribute=""Normal Text"" lineEndContext=""#pop"" fallthrough=""true"" fallthroughContext=""#pop""&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""\s*\{"" attribute=""Normal Text"" context=""#stay""/&gt;
    &lt;RegExpr String=""(verbatim|lstlisting|boxedverbatim|(B|L)?Verbatim)\*?"" attribute=""Environment"" context=""#stay""/&gt;
    &lt;DetectChar char=""}"" attribute=""Normal Text"" context=""#pop#pop#pop#pop#pop"" endRegion=""block""/&gt;
  &lt;/context&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And Change the second <code>RegExpr</code> line to:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;RegExpr String=""(verbatim|lstlisting|boxedverbatim|minted|(B|L)?Verbatim)\*?"" attribute=""Environment"" context=""#stay""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After that Kile should correctly highlight the <code>minted</code> environments.</p>

<p>I think there should be a way to add at least user-specific syntaxes, if not for each file, but I cannot find any <code>syntax</code> directory in <code>~/.kde/*</code>.</p>

<p>So, I want both of the dialogs to access the gamePlayer object.  At the moment, the only way I can think of doing it is to create the gamePlayer object as a global object, but these are normally frowned upon - is there a better way to do this?</p>

6035713,Showing Excel Documents on the Web,"<p>I'm looking for a way to present excel documents on the web either by :</p>

<p>converting Excel documents to html, css and javascript or by,
using silverlight control</p>

<p>I'm not looking for a way to program the conversion by my self. What I'm after is a control or library (open source or third - party ) which will enable me to present excel file inside a web browser.</p>

<p>SOLUTION:
We've found two solutions to this problem both which work and are free:
1. PHPExcell is an excellent third party library for reading and creating excel files. For our project we have created a PHP Rest service to which our .NET application sends the data which needs to be converted to excell and the resulting file is just sent then to the client.
2. For the second solution we have installed Open office and started it in its headless mode. We used its UNO CLI API to create an utility API in .NET for any conversion possible in Openoffice (e.g. Excell to PDF to Word etc., Convert(File, From: Format.Excell, To: Format.PDF) ). We used the Java tutorials on the web for this since the syntax is very similar.</p>

6035716,Confused about __str__ in Python,"<p>Coming from a Java background, I understand that <code>__str__</code> is something like a Python version of toString (while I do realize that Python is the older language).</p>

<p>So, I have defined a little class along with an <code>__str__</code> method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class Node:

    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.neighbours = []
        self.distance = 0


    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.id)

<p>I then create a few instances of it:</p>

<pre><code>uno = Node(1)    
due = Node(2)    
tri = Node(3)    
qua = Node(4)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the expected behaviour when trying to print one of these objects is that it's associated value gets printed. This also happens.</p>

<pre><code>print uno
</code></pre>

<p>yields</p>

<pre><code>1

<p>But when I do the following:</p>

<p>I'm working on a site in which I'd like to use YouTube's <b>HTML5</b> player to display sections of a video at predefined timestamps. I believe the code works correctly with the Flash player.</p>

<p>For argument's sake, in the referenced video, I wish to display the video at timestamps of 10s and 25s.</p>

<p>I think I'm doing everything correctly. The video is loaded multiple times and, ""onReady"", the code calls ""seekTo"" the timecode and then pauses the play.</p>

<p>Here's the code. If you're unfamiliar with JSBin, click ""Run with JS"" in the upper right hand corner of the ""Output"" screen to run it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/ereneh/3/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsbin.com/ereneh/3/edit</a></p>

<p>I feel as though I've tried all permutations but I'm unable to get the video to display a screenshot of the video at the timestamps. If I manually play the video to the timestamp and then pause, it works (as expected). If I let the code run and then hit ""play"", the video resumes from the correct timestamp and the image appears seemingly instantly.</p>

<p>Am I using the API incorrectly and/or overlooking something? Is this a bug?</p>

<p>The console shows repeated 404s but these occur once ""play"" is clicked and there is no evident problem that results; the video plays as expected. </p>

<p>Also I said that they were correlated because $Y$ changes as $X$ changes, meaning correlation right? I'm just feeling doubtful now. Some help please?</p>

I can get it to search if the search bar and the webView are in the same view controller.

Just like the Google homepage. The main page only has a search bar. Once you search, it takes you to a separate page showing the results.</p>

<p>The response is this: </p>

<p>The code is suposed to take the end of the URL request, pass that to the <code>iconKey</code> var, and use it as a blob key to access the blobstore for the image and create a serving url with the <code>images.get_serving_url()</code> method.</p>

<p>Anybody run into this before? I tried putting a <code>@staticmethod</code> parameter over the <code>get</code> definition, but of course, that made the <code>get</code> method not be able to access the request via <code>self</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I just changed something which got another error. I had been using the <code>([^/]+)?</code> regexp for the URL - where the URL would be <code>/view/icon/76M5e-xIStHRJDYyXBXjDA==</code> and the resource passed to the <code>get()</code> method would be the <code>76M5e-xIStHRJDYyXBXjDA==</code> ending of the URL.</p>

<p>I just change the regexp to <code>(.*)</code> as per @systempuntoout's answer below. Now I get this error: <code>AttributeError: split</code> with this stack trace:</p>

6035742,largest prefix of array of vertices that forms a convex polygon,"<p>Related to: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4174209/polygon-decomposition-removing-concave-points-to-form-convex-polygons"">Polygon Decomposition - Removing Concave Points to Form Convex Polygons</a></p>

<p>I am looking for an algorithm to do the following:</p>

<p>The input is an array of 2D points (P<sub>0</sub>…P<sub>N-1</sub>).  The length N of the array varies (3 ≤ N &lt; ∞)<br>
For any M ≤ N there may or may not be a convex polygon whose vertices are P<sub>0</sub>…P<sub>M-1</sub> in some order.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>  the edges are not necessarily adjacent pairs in the array.</p>

<p>What is the most efficient algorithm to find the maximum M such that this convex polygon exists?</p>

<p>My current algorithm is very inefficient.  I test with M=3 then M=4, M=5 etc., compute the hull then test that all P<sub>0</sub>…P<sub>M-1</sub> are vertices of the hull, if not then I break out of the loop and return M-1.</p>

<p>Example #1: <code>[(-2,2), (2,2), (-2,-2), (-1,1)]</code><br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/hDt5l.png"" alt=""Diagram for example #1""><br>
result: 3 (because the first three points form a triangle but adding P<sub>3</sub> = <code>(-1,1)</code> would make the polygon non-convex)</p>

<p>Example #2: <code>[(-2,2), (2,2), (-2,-2), (1,-1)]</code><br>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/sS8QN.png"" alt=""Diagram for example #2""><br>
result: 4 (because a convex quadrilateral can be constructed from all 4 points in the array)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Example #3: <code>[(-3,3), (3,3), (2,-1), (-3,-3), (3,-3), (-2,1)]</code>
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/c3qZA.png"" alt=""alt text""><br>
result: 4.  </p>

<p>This example demonstrates why it is not sufficient to take the convex hull of all supplied points and find a prefix that is a subset of it. <code>(3,-3)</code> cannot be part of a convex polygon consisting of the first five points because then the previous point <code>(2,-1)</code> would no longer lie on the hull.  But it is <code>(3,-3)</code> that must be rejected, even though it lies on the hull of all six points and <code>(2,-1)</code> does not.  </p>

<p>Examples of invalid inputs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[(-1,-1), (0,0)]</code> (too few points)</li>
<li><code>[(-1,-1), (0,0), (1,1), (1, -1)]</code> (first three points are colinear: I would not expect the algorithm to be able to handle this.)</li>
</ul>

6035743,Rounding DateTime Value to Nearest Hour with PHP and MySQL,"<p>So, I'm trying to count the number of hours between a DateTime value and the current date with PHP. I don't want to do it by seconds and then divide it into minutes and then hours, because I'd like for it to count each hour individually. For example, 4PM-5PM would be 1, 5PM-6PM would be 2, and so on. </p>

<p>So if the DateTime was 2012-09-24 7:49:23 and the current DateTime was 2012-09-24 8:00:19 it would output the number 1. And if the DateTime was 2012-09-24 7:49:23 and the current DateTime was 2012-09-24 8:59:45 it would still output 1. (It wouldn't change to 2 until 9:00:00)</p>

<p>The DateTime I'm using for comparison is coming out a database, and if I can figure out how I will make it so that it cuts off the minutes/seconds portion of the DateTime (so that they're 0). If I could do the same with the current DateTime it would be easy. The thing is, I don't know how to do that. So how can I turn 2012-09-24 7:49:23 into 2012-09-24 7:00:00 (It still needs to be in a DateTime format so I can put it back into the MySQL database in a DateTime field)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I appreciate both answers I received, but I tried tinkering with them and couldn't get exactly what I wanted. Instead, I was able to come up with on my own (through some more trial and error) what I needed to make this work. I've included it below in case anyone else has a similar issue.</p>

<pre><code>$timea = date_format(date_create(date(""c"")), 'Y-m-d H:00:00');
$timeb = date_format(date_create($databasedate), 'Y-m-d H:00:00');

//hours
$diff = abs(strtotime($timeb) - strtotime($timea));
$hours = round(($diff/60/60));
</code></pre>

<p>That code should all be pretty straightforward and easy to understand. Thanks again everyone :)</p>

"
6035745,PyQt: showing a file dialog after creating a pixMap produces a segmentation fault,"<p>I am developing a GUI with PyQt, to perform visual analysis of the data collected during some experiments. The GUI asks the user to indicate the directory where the data to be analyzed is located:</p>

<pre><code>class ExperimentAnalyzer(QtGui.QMainWindow):
    ## other stuff here

    def loadExperiment(self):
        directory = QtGui.QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory(self,
                                                           ""Select Directory"")
        ## load data from directory here
</code></pre>

<p>The GUI provides a <strong><em>play</em></strong> functionality, by means of which the user can see how experimental data changes over time. This is implemented through a <strong>QTimer</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>  def playOrPause(self):
      ## play
      if self.appStatus.timer is None:
          self.appStatus.timer = QtCore.QTimer(self)
          self.appStatus.timer.connect(self.appStatus.timer,
                                       QtCore.SIGNAL(""timeout()""),
                                       self.nextFrame)

          self.appStatus.timer.start(40)

       ## pause
       else:
          self.appStatus.timer.stop()
          self.appStatus.timer = None
</code></pre>

<p>If I <strong><em>play</em></strong> the temporal sequence of data, then <strong><em>pause</em></strong>, then try to change the directory to load data from a new experiment, I experience a <strong>segmentation fault</strong>. </p>

<p>Using some debug prints, I found out that the application crashes when I call</p>

<pre><code>    QtGui.QFileDialog.getExistingDirectory(self, ""Select Directory"")
</code></pre>

<p>in the <strong><em>loadExperiment</em></strong> method.</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to Qt and I think I'm not handling the timer properly.<br>
I'm using PyQt 4.9, Python 2.7.3 on Ubuntu 10.04.</p>

<h2><strong>Edit-1</strong>:</h2>

<p>After Luke's answer, I went back to my code.<br>
Here's the <strong><em>nextFrame</em></strong> method, invoked every time the timer emits the <strong><em>timeout</em></strong> signal. It updates a QGraphicsScene element contained in the GUI:</p>

<pre><code>def nextFrame(self):
    image = Image.open(""&lt;some jpg&gt;"")
    w, h = image.size
    imageQt = ImageQt.ImageQt(image)
    pixMap = QtGui.QPixmap.fromImage(imageQt)

    self.scene.clear()
    self.scene.addPixmap(pixMap)
    self.view.fitInView(QtCore.QRectF(0, 0, w, h),
                        QtCore.Qt.KeepAspectRatio)
</code></pre>

<p>where the self.scene and the self.view objects have been previously instantiated in the GUI constructor as</p>

<pre><code>self.view = QtGui.QGraphicsView(self)
self.scene = QtGui.QGraphicsScene()
self.view.setScene(self.scene)
</code></pre>

<p>I found out that commenting this line:</p>

<pre><code>    # self.scene.addPixmap(pixMap)
</code></pre>

<p>and repeating the same operations sequence reported above, the segmentation fault does not occur anymore.</p>

<h2><strong>Edit-2</strong>:</h2>

<p>Running the application with gdb (with python-dbg), it turns out that the segmentation fault occurs after a call to QPainter::drawPixmap.</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) bt
#0  0xb6861f1d in ?? () from /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4
#1  0xb685d491 in ?? () from /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4
#2  0xb693bcd3 in ?? () from /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4
#3  0xb69390bc in ?? () from /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4
#4  0xb6945c77 in ?? () from /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4
#5  0xb68bd424 in QPainter::drawPixmap(QPointF const&amp;, QPixmap const&amp;) () from   /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, it's not a problem related to timer handling, as I believed in first instance.<br>
The segmentation fault happens because I'm doing something wrong with the pixMap.</p>

6035748,Recommendation for a precalculus textbook,"<p>I'm a high school senior interested in pursuing a major in quantitative economics, which I understand is heavily math-intensive. However, as it stands, my academic strengths are more verbal (780 on SAT) than mathematical (630 on SAT). Therefore, I'd much like to increase my skills at math and plan to devote a great deal of my summer studying from a precalculus textbook or two. That's where you good people at Math Stack Exchange come in. I'm hoping some of you could recommend a precalculus level textbook that has the potential to initiate a neophyte such as myself to the math world. Bonus points if you can recommend a textbook that somehow also has applications to economics. </p>

<p>By the way, I actually have already purchased a precalculus level textbook, the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project's Precalculus and Discrete Mathematics, but am of the understanding that it is more of a primer text and thus would be wisely supplemented by something a little more in-depth. This might be helpful to take into consideration as well. I asked this same question at Math Overflow and was told that the site is more reserved for research-level mathematics, and was referred here instead, so I hope this is the right domain for this sort of question. Many thanks for any and all replies.</p>

6035755,understanding and improving sphinx searchd memory usage,"<p>My company has a few servers that we dedicate to running Sphinx Search. All are CentOS 5 with about 48GB of memory and our version of searchd is 1.11. Recently I've been trying to understand why Sphinx uses so little of the available memory for its regular indexes (we don't use RT indexes at the moment). <a href=""http://sphinxsearch.com/blog/2011/11/11/sphinx-memory-consumption/"" rel=""nofollow"">According to the official Sphinx website</a>, all files related to an index except for the .spd and .spp files are stored in RAM. At present this constitutes about 14GG for all our indexes, which can easily fit in RAM. However, when I consult htop for memory usage, it's showing a little less than 1.5GB being used! Interestingly enough, it reports that swap is being used as well, even with vm.swappiness set to 0. If I stop searchd, swap goes down to 0. (It should be noted that the amount of swap used is no greater that the amount of memory being used.) We have it configured so that all our indexes are preopened on startup (preopen_indexes = 1 in our sphinx conf).</p>

<p>I have two questions, given the above information:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is Sphinx doing with the data in those indexes, if it isn't keeping it in memory?</li>
<li>Is it possible to force Sphinx to keep more data in memory?</li>

<p>The definition of left $R$-module: $M$ is a left $R$-module if $M$ is an abelian group and $R$ a ring acting on $M$ such that </p>

<p>(i) $r(m_1 + m_2) = rm_1 + rm_2$</p>

<p>I don't understand what commutativity of $R$ has to do with the module being left and right. If $R$ is commutative it means that $r_1 r_2 = r_2 r_1$. Now how does it follow from that that $rm = mr$? $M$ is not a subset of $R$, it could be anything so how does commutativity of $R$ make elements of $M$ and $R$ commute, too?</p>

I need did cb with 2 column(double cb), i did this like this:</p>

<pre><code>ComboBox1.DataSource = dbDataSet.cb1.AsEnumerable()
          .Select(row =&gt; new 
               { 
                 Text = String.Format(""{0,5} | {1}"", row[""number""], row[""name""]),
                 Value = row[""id""]
               })
         .ToList();

ComboBox1.DisplayMember = ""Text"";
ComboBox1.ValueMember = ""Value"";
</code></pre>

<p>After this, when i switch something from list of cb, tb don't get values, he have still first value(when form loading, tb get value from first row of list cb, but dont get from next). 
I need did this, cause sql querry for add row in the table, have parameters with tb's(name + number), because i can't use combobox.Text(number + name in 1 column, i need in separate). Maybe somebody know a better way...</p>

"
6035760,Discrete Fourier transform,"<p>I am currently trying to write some fourier transform algorithm. I started with a simple DFT algorithm as described in the mathematical definition:</p>

<pre><code>public class DFT {
    public static Complex[] Transform(Complex[] input) {
        int N = input.Length;

        Complex[] output = new Complex[N];

        double arg = -2.0 * Math.PI / (double)N;
        for (int n = 0; n &lt; N; n++) {
            output[n] = new Complex();
            for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
                output[n] += input[k] * Complex.Polar(1, arg * (double)n * (double)k);
        }
        return output;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I tested this algorithm with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    private int samplingFrequency = 120;
    private int numberValues = 240;

    private void doCalc(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        Complex[] input = new Complex[numberValues];
        Complex[] output = new Complex[numberValues];

        double t = 0;
        double y = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberValues; i++) {
            t = (double)i / (double)samplingFrequency;
            y = Math.Sin(2 * Math.PI * t);
            input[i] = new Complex(y, 0);
        }

        output = DFT.Transform(input);

        printFunc(input);
        printAbs(output);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The transformation works fine, but only if numberValues is a multiple number of the samplingFrequency (in this case: 120, 240, 360,...). Thats my result for 240 values:</p>

<p><img src=""http://s1.directupload.net/images/110928/n3m8hqg6.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The transformation just worked fine.</p>

<p>If i am trying to calculate 280 values I get this result:</p>

<p><img src=""http://s7.directupload.net/images/110928/qizoiqbt.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Why I am getting a incorrect result if I change the number of my calculated values?
I am not sure if my problem here is a problem with my code or a misunderstanding of the mathematical definition of the DFT. In either way, can anybody help me with my problem? Thanks.</p>

<li><a href=""http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/"">HXT</a> seems to be the most advanced (but also the most difficult to learn thanks to arrows)</li>
<li><a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml"">xml</a> which seems to be just the basic parser</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.flightlab.com/~joe/hxml/"">HXML</a> seems to be abandoned</li>
<li>tagsoup and tagchup</li>
<li>libXML and libXML SAX bindings</li>
</ul>

<p>So, which library to choose if I want it</p>

<ul>
<li>to be reasonably powerful (to extract data from XML and to modify XML)</li>
<li>likely to be supported long time in the future</li>
<li>to be a “community choice” (default choice)</li>
</ul>

<p>And while most of the above seem to be sufficient for my current needs, what are the reason to choose one of them over the others?</p>

6035783,What's the Difference Between Subgraph Isomorphism and Subgraph Monomorphism?,"<p>In one of the projects I've worked on, the subject of <a href=""http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/11/13/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other"" rel=""nofollow"">isomorphism versus monomorphism came up</a>.</p>

<p>A little background: I'm no expert on graph theory and have no formal training in it. But this topic is very important in chemistry, where chemists expect a particular kind of subgraph matching to take place in the structure search systems they use.</p>

<p>If a target graph A has n nodes and m edges, then a chemist would accept subgraph matches in which a query graph B had n nodes and m-1 edges. The only requirement would be that every edge in B should be present in A. For example, a linear chain of 6 nodes should match a cycle of 6 nodes.</p>

<p>Is this kind of matching isomorphism or monomorphism? Maybe something else altogether?</p>

<p>What does not work is if I enter password but leave out something else, like reply to email. Instead of the Password label being display, the password itself gets displayed where it should say ""Password:"". For example, if the password is abcd, then abcd gets displayed as a label.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
This seems like a serious bug. If the attribute ""key"" of password is changed to anything other than Password or password, it gets displayed as the label.

6035792,"In Python, how do I write unit tests that can access private attributes without exposing them?","<p>I am trying to improve how I write my unit test cases for my Python programs. I am noticing in some cases, it would be really helpful to have access to private members to ensure that a method is functioning properly. An example case would be when trying to test a method for proper behavior that has no expected return value other than None. I know the easy and wrong way of doing this would be to just make the private attributes into protected attributes instead and test them directly. However, I would like to find a way that doesn't expose the interface as much.</p>

<p>So how do I test private attributes within classes without exposing them in the interface, or, if applicable, a better way of testing such a scenario so that private attribute access would not necessarily be needed for proper unit testing?</p>

6035797,git bash questions,"<p>i just downloaded msysgit from <a href=""http://msysgit.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msysgit.github.com/</a> and am trying to learn how to use it.  i also downloaded a copy of the pro git manual from their wiki. 
In chapter 2 it talks about typing ""$ git init"" in the project directory to have the system create a .git folder. </p>

<p>i'm just new at unix / linux so you'll have to excuse the simple questions. 
lets say my project folder is located at : 
c:\myapp\abc
and that's where i want to run the git init command </p>

<p>i'm not sure how i can change directories into the project folder. 
when i do an <strong>""ls""</strong> command  from where i'm at, i can tell by the contents in the folder that i'm actually in <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git.</strong>  i've tried ""cd /myapp/abc"" but it just gives me the message "" no such file or directory"".
i feel like i'm missing something really basic here.
my prompt when i open git bash is: </p>

<p>$myname@mypcname /</p>

<p>maybe i just need a bash tutorial? 
I've also been playing around with the GIT GUI and i was able to create a new repo in another project folder a  but i'd like to be able to follow the manual, which for now, seems to be working the git bash tool 
thanks.</p>

<p>I ran like that for an entire year without issue. I also know that it worked because some guy from Germany said, ""Hey, I heard about your website, but I can't connect to it."" So, I got to trusting him and poked a hole through for him. He then said, ""I can see your site. Thanks!"" (The reason I block the above countries is two-fold -- one, they're not my target customers at all, and two, I was getting heavy spambot traffic from those countries.)</p>

<p>Within a week ago, however, the shared hosting plan server was upgraded to the latest CentOS and cPanel. Now all of a sudden I'm getting 13 to 15 second page loads. <strong>If I comment out the above block, then no slowdowns at all -- super fast page loads.</strong></p>

<p>I tested from my Linux and Windows workstations at home testing with Opera, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and IE. My neighbor, running Windows and Firefox, is on Frontier Communications DSL like me and she has the same latency.</p>

<p>My clients and the web hosting provider as well get instant page loads. It's only the connection with Frontier Communications DSL that's having the problem.</p>

<p>I replaced my DNS as a test. On Linux I can edit my /etc/resolv.conf and use Google DNS, and the web gets faster. However, again -- still latency to my website.</p>

<p>I know that if I call up Frontier, all they will say is they don't know why the problem is occurring and that the problem is the web hosting provider. When I called my web hosting provider (a2hosting.com), they told me that the problem was only with my ISP, Frontier Communications, and that I should call them.</p>

6035802,Logical Operators: is AND better than OR?,"<p>Sorry if this is a comp-sci 101 question. I'm just unsure if I'm missing something obvious.</p>

<p>So let's say some user input throws an error, and I want to catch it and return some feedback. The error will be a number, 0 - 8. 0 means ""No Error"". I want to give the user very specific feedback if the error is 3 (No numbers allowed, let's say). For the other 7 possibilities, I just want to end the script and echo the error.</p>

<p>I was working this out and decided to go with this:</p>

<pre><code>$no_errors ($_error != 0 || $_error != 3) ? FALSE : TRUE;
if (!$no_errors)
echo $error_msg['$_error'];
$error_3 ($no_errors &amp;&amp; $_error == 3) ? TRUE : FALSE;
if ($error_3)
   bunch of stuff happens;
else
   bunch of other stuff;

<p>Anyways, I was then noticing the OR operator on the first line and was thinking that it might be better/safer to user an AND operator. But the more I contemplate, the less I see a difference. </p>

<p>So the real question is, if you want to eliminate two possibilities of a specific variable, are AND and OR identical, or is one logically/functionally more optimal? </p>

6035820,Event handler not removing itself?,"<p>At the beginning of a VB .NET function I remove an event handler and add it again at the end of the function because the function's code would trigger those events and I do not want them to trigger for the duration of the function.  This usually works, but I have run into a few situations where the event still gets called even though I have already removed it.  Sometimes removing it twice at the beginning of the function fixes it, but other times no matter how many times I remove it, it still fires.  Any ideas on what could be causing this?</p>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>

<p>The code is in a Form that has a virtual mode datagridview.  I want to run some operations that will trigger the CellValueNeeded event for the datagridview without that event being fired (because it will interfere).</p>

    RemoveHandler grid.CellValueNeeded, AddressOf grid_CellValueNeeded

    'Do things that would trigger CellValueNeeded

    AddHandler grid.CellValueNeeded, AddressOf grid_CellValueNeeded
End Sub

<p>Removing the handler multiple times does not prevent the event from firing, so it doesn't seem to be added multiple times somewhere else by accident.</p>

6035822,Doubt in Application of Integration - Calculation of volumes and surface areas of solids of revolution,"<p>I am using two books for my calculus refresher.</p>

<ol>
<li>Thomas' Calculus </li>
<li>Higher Math for Beginners by Ya. B. Zeldovich</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My question is :</strong> When applying Integral Calculus for calculation of volumes of solids, generated by curves revolved around an axis, we use slices of 'cylinders' to approximate the volume of the resulting solid and then integrate the sum of those infinitesimal cylinders. However, when we are using the same techniques to calculate the surface area of the surfaces generated by revolving curves around an axis, we consider the 'slope' of the differential length of curve 'dx', calculate the total length of the curve and derive the required surface area.</p>

<p>Are we not supposed to use the same 'slope' for calculating the volumes of the infinitesimal 'cylinders' for calculation of volumes? Shouldn't we use 'sliced portions of 'cones' as the infinitesimal volumes?? When it come to calculation of volumes of solids of revolution, why are we neglecting the slope of the curve for the differential length and simply assume that it is an infinitesimal cylinder??</p>

<p>Ex: Let us say we want to calculate the surface area and the volume of the solid generated when the parabola y = 10 . x^2 is revolved about the y-axis, with limits of x from 0 to 5.</p>

<p>In such cases, when calculating the volume of the solid, we consider infinitesimal 'cylinders', ignoring the 'slope' of the curve for the differential element 'dx', but when calculating the surface area, we consider the 'slope' of the differential element 'dx'.</p>

As far as I can tell, I'm using the Core Audio APIs correctly there, and nothing looks like it should be causing any glitches in <code>coreaudiod</code>, so I'm hoping that someone can either point out an issue with my code, or point me towards what else (possibly unrelated?) might be causing the CPU usage in <code>coreaudiod</code>. I should also note that when I observe <code>coreaudiod</code> using more CPU than normal, there's no sound playing, and the system is unmuted.</p>

6035838,Opening a document in read-only mode using an external control,"<p>I have a .Net application that (amongst other things) provides a front end to a sharepoint document library. Users are able to open documents, and I use the Open Documents Control to do so (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms454230%28v=office.12%29.aspx).</p>

<p>Most of the time the documents should be opened in edit mode, but certain documents should only be opened in read only mode (say I have a custom 'Category' field on each document, and if the category equal to 10 then the document should be read only). I currently use the EditDocument3 method to open files (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc264288%28v=office.12%29.aspx). However, I don't seem to see a way to open in a read only mode.</p>

<p>One thought I had would be to update the permissions of every user to only have Read access on that particular file, but I figured this would kill performance (some hundreds of users, some 160gb of files, documents changing from edit to read only fairly frequently).</p>

<p>Is there a way to flag a document as read only in sharepoint? I access sharepoint using c# through the object model.</p>

6035843,UIViewController not loading a UIView,"<p>Hey, I'm playing around with a script my teacher provided for a table based application. However I can't seem to get my own view to load.</p>

<p>Files:</p>

<ul>
<li>SubViewOneController (which is a sub view, also has a nib)</li>
<li>TapViewController (Custom UIView I created and want to add to a cell)</li>
<li>RootViewController (Main controller which loads in the views)</li>
<li>SimpleNavAppDelegate</li>
</ul>

<p>How it works: Within the RootViewController, there's an NSArray that holds NSDictionary objects which is declared in the -(void)awakeFromNib {} method</p>

<pre><code>- (void)awakeFromNib {

// we'll keep track of our views controllers in this array
views = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];      // when using alloc you are responsible for it, and you will have to release it.

// ====================================================================================================
// ====================================================================================================

// LOADING IN CUSTOM VIEW HERE:

// allocate a set of views and add to our view array as a dictionary item
TapViewController *tapBoardView = [[TapViewController alloc] init]; 

//push onto array
[views addObject:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                  @""Tab Gestures"",      @""title"",
                  tapBoardView,         @""controller"",
                  nil]];

[tapBoardView release]; //release the memory

// ====================================================================================================
// ====================================================================================================

SubViewOneController *subViewOneController = [[SubViewOneController alloc] init];

// This will set the 2nd level title
subViewOneController.title = @""Swipe Gestures""; //set it's title

//push it onto the array    
[views addObject:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                  @""Swipe Gestures"",    @""title"",
                  subViewOneController, @""controller"",
                  nil]];

[subViewOneController release]; //release the memory
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Later on I set the table view:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

// OUTPUT -- see console
NSLog(@""indexPath %i"", indexPath.row);  // OUTPUT: tapController: &lt;TapViewController: 0x3b2b360&gt;
NSLog(@""view object: %@"", [views objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]); // OUTPUT: view object: controller = &lt;TapViewController: 0x3b0e290&gt;; title = ""Tab Gestures"";

// ----- Hardcoding the controller and nib file in does work, so it's not a linkage issue ------
// UNCOMMENT TO SEE WORKING -- comment below section.
//TapViewController *tapContoller = [[TapViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""TapBoardView"" bundle:nil];
//NSLog(@""tapController: %@"", tapContoller); 
//[self.navigationController pushViewController:tapContoller animated:YES];

// ----- Random Tests -----
//UIViewController *targetViewController = [[views objectAtIndex: 0] objectForKey:@""controller""];       // DOES NOT WORK

// LOADS THE SECOND CELL (SubViewOneController) however will not load (TapViewController)
UIViewController *targetViewController = [[views objectAtIndex: indexPath.row] objectForKey:@""controller""];
NSLog(@""target: %@"", targetViewController); // OUTPUT: target: &lt;TapViewController: 0x3b0e290&gt;

[self.navigationController pushViewController:targetViewController animated:YES];   
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Reading the comments you should be able to see that hardcoding the view in, works - however trying to load it from the View NSArray does not work. It does however contain the object in memory, seeing that NSLog proves that.</p>

<p>Everything is linked up and working within the TapViewController nib file. So ya, im kinda stuck on this one, any help would be great!</p>

<p>Thanks guys</p>

I'll need to include some connectivity passwords on the App.config file, and I obviously don't want end-users to just fire up notepad and look at the passwords.</p>

<p>Several articles point on how to encrypt/decrypt configuration sections, but it appears you have to share/ship some keys with the deployable solution.</p>

<p>Is there a simpler way, to just cipher some of the settings so that they are not user-readable, but that don't require extra steps or files when redistributing the program? Great plus would be that accessing the configuration settings is still transparent inside the .NET code. I could always just create a custom method to salt/cipher the string and in my custom code decrypt it, but I'm wondering if there's something simpler.</p>

<p>Any answers or links to articles on how to do this are greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>

6035869,WPF GUI unresponsive updating ListView,"<p>UPDATE: It looks like the two  rows in the datatemplate are what is slowing it down. If I comment just those two lines out, ie </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Image Source=""{Binding IconSelect}"" Width=""20"" Height=""20"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Image Source=""{Binding IconBaseAcctFlag}"" Width=""20"" Height=""20"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine. Any idea why having these images in the datatemplate freeze the GUI when the list is being rendered to the list view?</p>

<p>I have a form which contains two panels. On the left is a tree view and when you click on a row, it then retrieves the corresponding data for this entity and builds up a summary pane on the right, represented by a list view.</p>

<p>I am fetching and processing the data on a background thread and then just using Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke() on the final call that sets the ItemsSource property of the ListView to the collection I have built up. I would have expected this to maintain a very responsive GUI but at the time of updating the ItemsSource property, the GUI freezes for about 1.5 seconds while this takes place and I'm not sure why this is taking so long. </p>

<p>Ive also tried binding an empty ObservableCollection at the start and then invoking the dispatcher on every addition to the collection. This makes it a bit more responsive but the panel loads line by line and it is still not the performance I would like, plus the code ends up very messy with so many dispatcher calls.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest what might be the issue here? Surely you can bind a generic collection with about 12-20 entries to a listview and have it update almost instantly?</p>

<p>Do people still use the
1991 ""data compression interface"" draft standard, and the
1991 ""Stream transformation algorithm interface"" draft standard.
(Both <a href=""http://www.ross.net/compression/interface.html"" rel=""nofollow"">draft standards by Ross Williams</a>)?
Are there any alternatives to those draft standards?</p>

<p>(I'm particularly looking for C APIs, but links to compression-oriented APIs in C++ and other languages would also be appreciated).</p>

<p>I'm experimenting with some data compression algorithms.
Typically the compressed file I'm producing is composed of a series of blocks,
with a block header indicating which compression algorithm needs to be used to decompress the remaining data in that block -- Huffman, LZW, LZP, ""stored uncompressed"", etc.</p>

<p>The block header also indicates which filter(s) need to be used to convert the intermediate stream or buffer of data from the decompressor into a lossless copy of the original plaintext -- Burrows–Wheeler transform, delta encoding, XML end-tag restoration, ""copy unchanged"", etc.</p>

<p>Rather than use a huge switch statement that selects based on the ""compression type"", which calls the selected decompression algorithm or filter algorithm, each procedure with its own special number and order of parameters,
it simplifies my code if every algorithm has exactly the same API -- the same number and order of parameters, etc.</p>

<p>Rather than waiting for the decompressor to run through the entire input stream before handing its output to the first filter,
It would be nice if the API supported decompressed output data coming out the final filter ""relatively quickly"" (low-latency) after relatively little compressed data has been fed into the initial decompressor.
It would be nice if the API could be used in systems that have only one thread or process.</p>

<p>Currently I'm kludging together my own internal API,
re-using existing compression algorithm implementations by
writing short wrapper functions to convert between my internal API and the special number and order of parameters used by each implementation.</p>

<p>Is there an already-existing API that I could use rather than designing my own from scratch?
Where can I find such an API?</p>

6035881,Suggested approach for creating asp.net MVC and WCF service application,"<p>I am working on a web service which is going to have both a native WPF client as well as a Javascript based web interface.</p>

<p>While I was working on the service and WPF client, the WCF service has been an IIS hosted WCF service project of its own, and has been working fine. Now that I'm starting to work in earnest on the web interface, I am wondering if keeping the WCF service separate is a good choice.</p>

<p>Reading around on the subject, there seem to be lots of options regarding this; for example, I could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the two projects separate</li>
<li>Create the asp.net MVC website and add an Ajax-enabled WCF service to the project</li>
<li>Create the asp.net MVC website and add a WCF service to the project</li>
<li>Create a WCF service library project and have that hosted in the MVC application (not entirely sure about this, but it seems possible)</li>
</ul>

<p>And I have a feeling there's probably more.</p>

<p>What do you suggest I should do? My goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing the service from the WCF client using a service reference like I have done so far</li>
<li>Accessing the service from Javascript on the web interface</li>
<li>Accessing the service using port 80 from Javascript and the WCF client (to avoid firewall issues)</li>
<li>Having website and service under the same domain</li>
<li>Being able to run the thing using shared hosting (Gearhost), without multiple IIS virtual directories/application starting points.</li>

6035882,Nagios remote monitoring: NRPE Vs. SSH,"<p>We use Nagios to monitor quite a few (~130) servers. We monitor CPU, Disk, RAM and a few other things on each server. I've always used SSH to run the remote commands, purely because it requires little to no additional config on the remote server, just install nagios-plugins, create the nagios user and add the SSH key, all of which I've automated into a shell script. I've never actually considered the performance implications of using SSH over NRPE.</p>

<p>I'm not too bothered about the load hit on the Nagios server (It's probably over-speced for what it does, it's never been over 10% CPU), but we run each remote check every 30 seconds and each server has 5 different checks performed. I assume SSH requires more resources for each check but is there a huge difference? (I.E. enough of a difference to warrant the switch to NRPE).</p>

<p>If it's any help, we monitor a mix of physical servers (Normally with 8, 12 or 16 physical cores) and Amazon EC2 medium/large instances.</p>

6035884,"const cast to allow read lock, does this smell bad?","<p>I want to execute a read-only method on an object marked as <code>const</code>, but in order to do this thread-safely, I need to lock a readers-writer mutex:</p>

<p>But this breaks because the compiler complains about ""children_"" being <code>const</code> and such. I went up to the ScopedRead class and up to the RWMutex class (which <code>children_</code> is a sub-class) to allow <code>read_lock</code> on a const object, but I have to write this:</p>

6035885,Can XDomainRequest be made to work with SSL?,"<p>I have code that uses Microsoft's XDomainRequest object in IE8. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var url = ""http://&lt;host&gt;/api/acquire?&lt;query string&gt;"";

xdr.onload = function(){

xdr.open(""GET"", url);  
xdr.send();  
</code></pre>

<p>When the scheme in ""url"" is ""http://"" the command works fine. However, when the scheme is ""https://"" IE8 gives me an ""Access denied"" JavaScript error. Both schemes work fine in FF 3.6.3, where I am, of course, using XmlHttpRequest. With both browsers I am complying with W3C Access Control. ""http://"" works cross origin for both browsers. So the problem is with IE8, XDomainRequest, and SSL.</p>

<p>The SSL certificate is not the problem. If I type https://<code>&lt;host</code>>/ into the address bar of IE8, where <code>&lt;host</code>> is the same as in ""url"" above, the page loads fine.  </p>

<p>So we have the following:<br>
- hitting https://<code>&lt;host</code>>/ directly from the browser works fine;<br>
- hitting https://<code>&lt;host</code>>/api/acquire?<code>&lt;query string</code>> via XDomainRequest is not allowed.</p>

<p>Can it be done? Am I leaving something out? </p>

6035894,Widget ninepatch - blur bug on android 4.0?,"<p>I've got some problems with ninepatch images on Android 4.0. Under Gingerbread, the widget used to look like that:</p>

<p><img src=""http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/3313/screenshot1321536776703.png"" alt=""gingerbread""></p>

<p>As you can see, the contures are quite sharp.</p>

<p>On Android Ice Cream Sandwich, the widget looks quite different (although the app has not been changed at all):</p>

<p><img src=""http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/8602/screenshot2011120217535.png"" alt=""ics""></p>

<p>The contures are rather blurry, the icons do not look good anymore. I tried a lot to rule out that it's just to a wrong dpi recognition (the devices dpi variable is still the same), for instance copied the resource into ""drawable-nodpi"". This did not change anything.</p>

<p>Then I recognized that there is one icon which is not blurry. It's the star in the bottom right corner. It's in the same folder than all other images, but it's the only graphic which is not a ninepatch but a normal graphic (iow: there is no .9 in the filename). When I added a .9 to it's filename, this star got blurry too.</p>

<p>So it seems, as if ICS scales the graphics down and up again which ends up in blurry conturs.</p>

<p>Did anybody experienced this too? Might this be an Android bug?</p>

<p>I'm quite puzzled...</p>

"
6035898,Shift/reduce problem with C-like grammar under Bison,"<p>I've been working on a C-like grammar for my personal amusement. However, I've been running into shift/reduce conflicts, and I'm quite sure they could be resolved.</p>

<p>Right now my <code>expressions</code> look like this, in a simplified form, stripped of actions:</p>

<pre><code>%left '+' '-'

%%
expr
 : NUMBER
 | IDENTIFIER
 | expr '+' expr
 | expr '-' expr
 /* other operators like '*', '/', etc. */
 | expr '(' expr ')' /* function call */
%%
</code></pre>

<p>However, this results in shift/reduce conflicts: the parser is unsure about how to treat parentheses. From what <code>-v</code> tells me, it is unclear whether an expression like <code>expr '+' expr '('</code> should reduce <code>expr '+' expr</code> into <code>expr</code> or shift the parenthesis.</p>

<p>Obviously, I want the parenthesis to be shifted. <code>foo % bar(4)</code> shouldn't end up being <code>(foo % bar)(4)</code>. However, I've had no success using the <code>%prec</code> directive to that mean. Adding <code>%left FUNCALL</code> and <code>%prec FUNCALL</code> after the rule yields no change.</p>

<p>I know that the default path Bison's LARL parsers will go when encountering a shift/reduce will be to shift, and that I could just use <code>%expect</code> to <strike>fix</strike> work around the problem. However, one conflict is generated for each expression, and would I ever need to change that list, I'll also need to change the <code>%expect</code> declaration, which looks like a rather ugly solution to me. Besides, I'm sure one of you wise kids have a solution to that problem.</p>

<p>My goal is to have a rule similar to the one above, for which Bison will know that whenever it encounters the <code>'('</code> from the function call rule, it has shift the parenthesis, without a possible shift/reduce conflict. For the record, my use of the <code>%prec</code> directive is the following, so if I'm just doing it wrong you can correct me. It does have the shift/reduce conflict.</p>

<pre><code>%left '+' '-'
%left FUNCALL

%%

expr
    : NUMBER
    | IDENTIFIER
    | expr '+' expr
    | expr '-' expr

<p>I'm looking to build an array that uses the API keys and the form value. For example: $data[12345] = 'John'. And actually, if there are multiple forms to submit, it should be $data[0][12345] = 'John', $data[1][12345] = 'Jane', and so on.</p>

<p>Here's my current solution:</p>

<pre><code>//$return is an object containing all the form submissions
 $i = 0;
        $data = array();
        foreach ($return as $ret) {
            foreach ($ret as $k =&gt; $v) {
                    // function that runs a mySQL query ""SELECT apikey FROM api WHERE formkey = '$k'"" and returns the apikey
                    $apikey = getApiKey($k);
                    $data[$i][$apikey] = $v; 
            }
            $i++;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but is obviously not optimal since it runs multiple queries. Is there a way to clean this up?</p>

6035906,_end symbol disappears when linking to libcurl,"<p>On Linux, the D runtime library relies on the <code>_end</code> symbol in determining the GC root ranges (<code>man 3 end</code>), which is in fact very similar to what the Boehm GC does. However, when linking in libcurl, the symbol is no longer found by the linker:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

extern char _end[];
int main() {
    printf(""%p\n"", &amp;_end);
    return 0;
}

$ gcc test.c # works
$ gcc test.c -lcurl
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccOPtbEv.o: undefined reference to symbol '_end'
/usr/bin/ld: note: '_end' is defined in DSO /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 so try adding it to the linker command line
/usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0: could not read symbols: Invalid operation
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
</code></pre>

<p>From a quick search on the D forums, libpq, libdw and several other libraries seem to trigger the same problem. Any idea what could be happening here? <strong><code>test.c</code> doesn't even depend on symbols from libcurl.</strong> (Arch Linux x86_64, GCC 4.7.2, ld 2.23)</p>

<p>Also, please note that »try linking in libssl« is not the answer I am looking for, I want to understand what is happening here. I'm trying to fix this problem in a compiler I'm working on, so you can assume basic familiarity with how the linking process works.</p>

<p>Edit: The reason why I'm not particularly satisfied with telling the users to just link in libssl, ..., explicitly is that <code>pkg-config --libs curl</code>, <code>curl-config --libs</code>, etc. don't contain this information; requiring it would thus break build systems. If anyone has a better idea for determining the bounds of the data (initialized and BSS) segments, I'd be keen to know.</p>

<p>Edit 2: With the toolchain mentioned above, <code>end</code> (without the underscore) also seems to be defined, and it doesn't trigger the problem. Still baffled as to why it occurs, though.</p>

6035909,Why does an HTML <a> tag inside a section/div produce a duplicate outside of the section/div?,"<p>I've been trying to make a scroller for a website with some arrows on the side, but the arrows are going crazy and duplicating themselves in following sections.  I've simplified the problem to the below - when I put one a-tag inside a section, where the a-tag is a colored shape thanks to some CSS, it produces a duplicate after the section ends.  Here is some code below to try out:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
a#block { height:30px; width:30px; display:block; background:blue; }
&lt;/style&gt;

    &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

<p>I realise that the above looks like terrible use of mark up, but it's for a reason.  The block is a simplification of an action arrow (hence the  tag), and the section is necessary as there will be more inside of it.</p>

<p>I have no idea why this is happening, I never thought that HTML elements could duplicate.  Any ideas?</p>

6035910,"Android: How to get latest intent triggered by NFC by calling getIntent() in onResume, in a running activity?","<p>I just started using NFC tags for an Android Application development. 
The application contains a single activity, which is <strong>MainActivity</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>MainActivity</strong> reads from NFC tags. I want to let it read from the latest detected tag by 
using <strong><em>getIntent()</em></strong> in <strong><em>onResume</em></strong> to get the latest intent. I did override <strong><em>onNewIntent(Intent intent)</em></strong> and call <strong><em>setIntent(intent)</em></strong> in it, and set <strong>""singleTop""</strong> launchMode for <strong>MainActivity</strong>.</p>

<p>However, when a tag is detected, system will call <strong><em>onResume()</em></strong> , and <strong><em>onNewIntent()</em></strong> is never called. <strong><em>getIntent()</em></strong> in <strong><em>onResume</em></strong> will always return intent of <strong>action MAIN</strong>, which is the original intent used when <strong>MainActivity</strong> is first launched.</p>

<p>At the beginning I didn't know how to start. Then I thought, no matter the value that $x$ takes, $sin(x^2)$ will always be between $-1$ and $1$. So for large values of $x$, $sin(x^2)$ is insignificant. One can rewrite:</p>

<p>$$\lim_{x \to +\infty} \space \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$$</p>

6035921,Sorting an array of objects in Chrome,"<p>I just got a report that some code I wrote is breaking on Chrome. I've tracked it down to a custom method I'm using to sort an array of objects. I am really tempted to call this a bug, but I'm not sure it is.</p>

<p>In all other browsers when you sort an array of objects, if two objects resolve to the same value their order in the updated array is left unchanged. In Chrome, their order is seemingly randomized. Run the code below in Chrome and any other browser you want. You should see what I mean.</p>

<p>I have two questions: </p>

<p>First, was I right in assuming that when your custom sorter returns <code>0</code> that the two compared items <em>should</em> remain in their original order (I have a feeling I was wrong). </p>

<p>Second, is there any good way of fixing this? The only thing I can think of is adding an auto-incrementing number as an attribute to each member of the array before sorting, and then using that value when two items <code>sort</code> is comparing resolve to the same value. In other words, never return 0.</p>

<p>Here's the sample code:</p>

<pre><code>var x = [
{'a':2,'b':1},
{'a':1,'b':2},
{'a':1,'b':3},
{'a':1,'b':4},
{'a':1,'b':5},
{'a':1,'b':6},
{'a':0,'b':7},
]

var customSort = function(a,b) {
    if (a.a === b.a) return 0;
    if (a.a &gt; b.a) return 1;
    return -1;
};

console.log(""before sorting"");
for (var i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) {
    console.log(x[i].b);
}
x.sort(customSort);

console.log(""after sorting"");
for (var i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) {
    console.log(x[i].b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In all other browsers, what I see is that only the first member and the last member of the array get moved (I see <code>7,2,3,4,5,6,1</code>) but in Chrome the inner numbers are seemingly randomized.</p>

<p>[EDIT] Thank you very much to everyone who answered. I guess that 'inconsistent' doesn't necessary mean it's a bug. Also, I just wanted to point out that my <code>b</code> property was just an example. In fact, I'm sorting some relatively wide objects on any one of about 20 keys according to user input. Even keeping track of what the user last sorted by still won't solve the problem of the randomness I'm seeing. My work-around will probably be a close variation of this (new code is highlighted):</p>

<pre><code>var x = [
{'a':2,'b':1},
{'a':1,'b':2},
{'a':1,'b':3},
{'a':1,'b':4},
{'a':1,'b':5},
{'a':1,'b':6},
{'a':0,'b':7},
];
var i;

var customSort = function(a,b) {
    if (a.a === b.a) return a.customSortKey &gt; b.customSortKey ? 1 : -1; /*NEW CODE*/
    if (a.a &gt; b.a) return 1;
    return -1;
};

console.log(""before sorting"");
for (i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) {console.log(x[i].b);}

for (i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) {                      /*NEW CODE*/
    x[i].customSortKey = i;                           /*NEW CODE*/
}                                                     /*NEW CODE*/
x.sort(customSort);

console.log(""after sorting"");
for (i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) {console.log(x[i].b);}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: According to the <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""PDF"">ECMA spec</a>, when two objects are determined to be equal in a custom sort, JavaScript is <strong>not</strong> required to leave those two objects in the same order. Both Chrome and Opera are the only two major browsers to choose to have non-stable sorts, but others include Netscape 8&amp;9, Kazehakaze, IceApe and a few others. The Chromium team has marked this bug as ""Working as intended"" so it will not be ""fixed"". If you need your arrays to stay in their original order when values are equal, you will need to employ some additional mechanism (such as the one above). Returning <code>0</code> when sorting objects is effectively meaningless, so don't bother.</p>

6035926,How can I recognize slightly modified images?,"<p>I have a very large database of jpeg images, about 2 million.  I would like to do a fuzzy search for duplicates among those images.  Duplicate images are two images that have many (around half) of their pixels with identical values and the rest are off by about +/- 3 in their R/G/B values.  The images are identical to the naked eye.  It's the kind of difference you'd get from re-compressing a jpeg.</p>

<p>I already have a foolproof way to detect if two images are identical: I sum the delta-brightness over all the pixels and compare to a threshold.  This method has proven 100% accurate but doing 1 photo against 2 million is incredibly slow (hours per photo).</p>

<p>I would like to fingerprint the images in a way that I could just compare the fingerprints in a hash table.  Even if I can reliably whittle down the number of images that I need to compare to just 100, I would be in great shape to compare 1 to 100.  What would be a good algorithm for this?</p>

6035928,Netgear Router missing Wireless Configuration Menu Link,"<p>I have a Netgear WiFi router DG834G v3. On it it says it's a WiFi, ADSL 2+ modem, switch, etc. There is an antenna on the back and a WiFi indicator on the front. However, when I connect to it via the web interface, the wireless setup link is missing from the menu. The top label indicates it is a DG834 (without G). I have received it from a friend and was really looking forward to using it but I really need the WiFi part.</p>

<p>I looked on Netgear's site as I thought someone must have uploaded the wrong firmware for the device sometime - so I upgraded to the latest firmware, but it still says it's NOT a 'G' device and the wireless menu is nowhere to be found.</p>

Many of the objects seem to inherit from BusinessBase and BusinessListBase. When I ""go to definition"" in Visual Studio, I see that these classes are a part of the CSLA namespace. What are these classes? What role do they play in the CSLA framework?  How do they relate to other CSLA concepts like Root Object and Child Object? </p>

6035942,What is the correct way to access a derived class object in a base class pointer container?,"<p>I have a <code>vector&lt;boost::shared_ptr&lt;Base&gt;&gt;</code> object. I'm inserting an object of type <code>Derived</code> where <code>Derived</code> inherits <code>Base</code> like this: <code>container.push_back(boost::shared_ptr&lt;Base&gt;(new Derived()));</code></p>

<p>I now want to call a function which takes a reference to a member of <code>Derived</code>, in order to modify this last entry I just inserted. This way, I don't end up creating a temporary instance of this <code>Derived</code> object. This is how I'm able to do it: <code>func(static_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;(&amp;*container.back())-&gt;member);</code></p>

<p>This looks really scary-ugly for me. But if I try to do <code>func(static_cast&lt;Derived&gt;(*container.back()).member);</code> instead, the compiler says I need to provide a ctor for <code>Derived</code> which takes the args <code>(const Base&amp;)</code> in order to convert an instance of Base to an instance of Derived, which I don't need to do here... I just want to refer to my shared_ptr pointer as though it were a <code>Derived*</code> because I know it is because I just <code>new</code>ed it. </p>

6035943,Python 3.3 readlines truncating text file,"<p>I am working with Python 3.3 using PyDev for Eclipse, Alright, so this is my code:</p>

<pre><code>countdata = open(countfilename, 'r')
countlist = countdata.readlines()
print(len(countlist))
genecountline = wordlist(countlist[-1])
print(genecountline)
</code></pre>

<p><code>countfilename</code> refers to a rather lengthy text file of 7847 lines that is generated from a text file using a script given to me by the instructor in my machine learning class (I did have to convert said script to Python 3 using 2to3).</p>

<p><code>wordlist</code> is a simple function I built that takes a line of text and returns the words in it as a list.</p>

<p>I pull the whole file into a list of lines so that I an refer to specific lines at will for my calculation.  Whether I read them in all at once with readlines or iterate over the file and add the lines to the list one by one like this:</p>

<pre><code>countdata = open(countfilename, 'r')
countlist = []
for line in countdata:
    countlist.append(line)
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't matter.  Either way I do it, <code>print(len(countlist))</code> gives me approximately <code>7630</code>, I say approximately because sometimes it is as low as <code>7628</code> or as high as <code>7633</code>.  The specific line returned by <code>countlist[-1]</code> is always different (the file is built using a generator object, as mentioned my instructor built that script and I am not entirely sure how exactly it works).</p>

<pre><code>genecountline = wordlist(countlist[-1])
print(genecountline)
</code></pre>

<p>I put in just to see what python thinks the last line of the file is.  And when I open the file in textpad, the line it returns is in fact the line number returned by <code>len(countlist)</code>.  In other words it appears to be ignoring the last approx. 210 lines of my file.  So my question is how do I fix this, and how do I prevent it from doing this again?</p>

6035944,Utilize ASP.NET theme specific to browser and browser version,"<p>My team is developing an ASP.NET web application, and we are attempting to maintain a consistent look and feel across browser type and version for a couple of the major browsers(IE, Chrome, Firefox). We would also like to allow themeing if possible , so that users can have a choice of color, font size, and so on.
However, I am having a serious issue with Acheiving compatibility with IE 8 and 9 due to some CSS3 rules currently in place. In particular, the shading gradient's used in this <code>div</code> are causing trouble, as they are not supported in IE 8 or 9: </p>

<pre><code>#logos
{
    width:1024px;
    height:100px;
    border-radius:15px;
    color: -moz-linear-gradient(bottom, #297381, #FFFFFF);
    color: -ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #297381, #FFFFFF);
    color: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, #297381,#FFFFFF);
    background:-moz-linear-gradient(bottom, #297381,#FFFFFF);
    background:-ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #297381,#FFFFFF);
    background:-webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, #297381,#FFFFFF);

}
</code></pre>

<p>I believe(correct me if I am wrong) I can achieve the gradient in IE9 by adding these rules:</p>

<pre><code>-ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorStr='#297381', EndColorStr='#FFFFFF')"";
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorStr=’#297381’, EndColorStr='#FFFFFF');
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think there is any corresponding option in IE8 and I don't believe it supports <code>border-radius</code> either. I was hoping to just have a separate theme or rule utilizing a static image for the background of that <code>div</code>. Is there any way I can detect browser version in css and apply the correct rule or theme? Or does this have to be done in the code behind and set the theme accordingly from there?</p>

6035946,Trouble recognizing digits in Tesseract - android,"<p>I was hoping someone could tell me why it is my Tesseract has trouble recognizing some images with digits, and if there is something i can do about it.
Everything is working according to test, and since it is only digits i need, i thought i could manage with the english pattern untill i had to start with the 7segmented display aswell.</p>

<p>Though i am having a lot of trouble with the appended images, i'd like to know if i should start working on my own recognition algorithms or if I could do my own datasets for Tesseract and then it would work, does anyone know where the limitation lies with Tesseract?</p>

<p>things tried:
tried to set psm to one_line, one_word, one_char(and chop up the picture).
With one_line and one_word there was no significant change.
with one_char it did recognize a bit better, but sometimes, due to big spacing it attached an extra number to it, which then screwed it up, if you look at the attached image <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ljnl7.jpg"" alt=""zero.jpg""> then it resulted in 04.
I have also tried to do the binarization myself, this resulted in poorer recognition and was very rescource consuming.
I have tried to invert the pictures, this makes no difference at all for tesseract.</p>

<p>I have attached the pictures i'd need, among others, to be processed.</p>

<p>Explaination about the images:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/G2bOb.jpg"" alt=""decodethisimage_seven""> is a image that the tesseract has no trouble recognizing, though it has been made in word for the conveniences of building an app around a working image.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cq7V.jpg"" alt=""decodethisimage_eight""> is real life image matching the image_seven. But it cannot recognize this.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/IYX9T.jpg"" alt=""decodethisimage_four2""> is another image i'd like it to recognize, and yes i know it cant be skrewed, and i did unskrew(think skrew is the term here==""straighting"") it when testing.</p>

<p>Currently, I had a project (GWT, J2EE and Swing), which I need to use Eclipse (Please do not ask Why)</p>

<p>Here is the step I had been taken.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <em>Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers (190 MB)</em> from <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a> I thought this should be the correct choice, as I see most features are found in that edition <a href=""http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/compare-packages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/compare-packages</a></li>
<li>After struggling a while to get use to the user interface of Eclipse, I still cannot find a <strong>Visual GUI Editor</strong>!</li>
<li>After doing some Googling, I realize I need to install something called <strong>Plugins</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>However, tones of plugins which had similar features has confused me, as I found</p>

6035951,Recursive CoreData attributes,"<p>I have a potentially stupid question about a potentially stupid database design.</p>

<p>Say I have this design (in an iOS project using CoreData):</p>

<p><strong>Class A</strong><br>
- name: NSString<br>
- children: NSSet of Class A objects<br>
- parent: Class A object</p>

<p>so it's a simple parent/child setup. This is all fine.</p>

<p>Now, I want to make it so that if a Class A object doesn't define a value for 'name', its parents are searched until one is found that does define 'name' and this value is returned.</p>

<p>This is a tricky thing to do, because my natural reaction was to override the getter for name like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)name
{
  return name =! nil ? name : self.parent.name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't work because 'name' has to be accessed via self.name because this is a CoreData entity.</p>

<p>Then I had the idea of making a new method called nameRecursive which works like:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)nameRecursive
{
  return self.name =! nil ? self.name : self.parent.name;
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this feels very clunky and not very elegant (as the real life version of Class A has many properties which need to work like this), but I haven't been able to think up anything nicer.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on a) whether or not this is a stupid design or b) how I might solve it in an elegant way.</p>

<p>Any ideas or thoughts would be brilliant. Thanks in advance.</p>

6035969,Is there a way to write to Google Drive from Android using application's account,"<p>I have a task to write files generated by an Android app to an application user account (or a service account). 
I have been looking around for any help and found <a href=""https://developers.google.com/drive/examples/android"" rel=""nofollow"">this sample</a></p>

<p>This sample app expects that the user account is setup on the phone. 
It also asks for user's permission to write files to the drive account.</p>

<p>But given that my app uses ""service account"" or an application account, it should:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write to the <em>application's</em> Google Drive account, without prompting the user for picking an account. Because it is guaranteed that the user's phone will and should not have application account.</p></li>
<li><p>Does not ask for any permissions, because user has no clue about scopes or drive account info.</p></li>
</ul>

6035973,"Graph implementation, functions and parameters. What makes more sense?","<p>Just for kind of ""fun"" I'm developing almost every algorithm (if possible) shown in the book Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen) in C. I've reached the graphs chapters and I'm not sure how to design my functions, but first take a look at my data structures (hope this will make clear my question).</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct s_multi_matrix
    {
     int     width;
     int     height;
     int     depth;
     multi_matrix_type type; // stores either MMTYPE_INT or MMTYPE_RECORD enums to know where to read values (ivals or rvals)
     int *    ivals;
     DT_record *   rvals;
    } DT_multi_matrix;

typedef struct s_double_linked_list
    {
     DT_record * sentinel;
    } DT_double_linked_list;

typedef struct s_record // multi purpose structure
    {
     int key;
     enum e_record_type type; // stores either TYPE_INT, TYPE_SZ, TYPE_FLOAT, TYPE_VOID to know how to use the data union
     union
     {
      int  ival;
      char * sval;
      float fval;
      void * vval;
     } data;
     struct s_record * left, // for trees, disjoint sets and linked lists
         * right,
         * parent;
    } DT_record;


typedef struct s_graph  // this is the structure I'm focusing on right now
    {
     graph_type    type;  // GRAPH_DIRECTED or GRAPH_UNDIRECTED
     graph_adj_type   adj_type; // ADJ_LIST or ADJ_MATRIX
     edge_type   etype; // WEIGHTED or NOT_WEIGHTED
     union
     {
      DT_double_linked_list *  list;
      DT_multi_matrix *   matrix;
     } adjacency;
    } DT_graph;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm thinking about several functions to manipulate the DT_graph type:</p>

<pre><code>// takes a pointer to a pointer to a graph, allocates memory and sets properties
void build_graph(DT_graph ** graph_ptr, graph_type gtype, graph_adj_type atype);
// prints the graph in file (using graphviz)
void print_graph(DT_graph * graph, char * graph_name);
</code></pre>

<p>This is the tricky part, since my graph type has several different type combinations (undirected and weighted edges, directed and weighted edges, undirected and not weighted edges, directed and not weighed edges, ...) I'm wondering which is the best approach for the functions:</p>

<pre><code>void dgraph_add_wedge(DT_graph * graph, DT_record * u, DT_record * v, int weight);
void ugraph_add_wedge(DT_graph * graph, DT_record * u, DT_record * v, int weight);
void dgraph_add_nwedge(DT_graph * graph, DT_record * u, DT_record * v);
void ugraph_add_nwedge(DT_graph * graph, DT_record * u, DT_record * v);
</code></pre>

<p>The first two would add a weighted vertex into a directed / undirected graph and the last two would do the same thing but without any weight related to the edge.
The other approach that comes to my mind looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void graph_add_edge(DT_graph * graph, DT_record * u, DT_record * v, edge_type etype, graph_type gtype);
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like a ""golden"" method for everything, and depending on the values for etype and gtype would do different operations on the graph.</p>

<p>Soooooooo, based upon your experiences and knowledge, what do you recommend?</p>

<p>BTW, I'm sure that any one has asked this before, since this is MY implementation.</p>

6035974,"Mutable, (possibly parallel) Haskell code and performance tuning","<p>I have now <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7893786/how-to-make-my-haskell-program-faster-comparison-with-c"">implemented another</a> SHA3 candidate, namely Grøstl. This is still work in progress (very much so), but at the moment a 224-bit version pass all KATs. So now I'm wondering about performance (again :->). The difference this time, is that I chose to more closely mirror the <a href=""http://www.groestl.info/implementations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">(optimized) C implementation</a>, i.e. I made a port from C to Haskell. The optimized C  version use table-lookups to implement the algorithm. Furthermore the code is heavily based on updating an array containing 64-bit words. Thus I chose to use mutable unboxed vectors in Haskell. </p>

<p>My Grøstl code can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/hakoja/SHA3/blob/master/Data/Digest/GroestlMutable.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hakoja/SHA3/blob/master/Data/Digest/GroestlMutable.hs</a></p>

<p>Short description of the algorithm: It's a Merkle-Damgård construction, iterating a compression function (<strong>f512M</strong> in my code) as long as there are 512-bits blocks of message left. The compression function is very simple: it simply runs two different independent 512-bit permutations <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> (<strong>permP</strong> and <strong>permQ</strong> in my code) and combines their output. Its these permutations which are implemented by lookup tables. </p>

<p><strong>Q1)</strong> The first thing that bothers me is that the use of mutable vectors makes my code look really fugly. This is my first time writing any major mutable code in Haskell so I don't really know how to improve this. Any tips on how I might better strucure the monadic code would be welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Q2)</strong> The second is performance. Actually It's not too bad, because at the moment the Haskell code is only 3 times slower. Using GHC-7.2.1 and compiling as such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ghc -O2 -Odph -fllvm -optlo-O3 -optlo-loop-reduce -optlo-loop-deletion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the Haskell code uses 60s. on an input of ~1GB, while the C-version uses 21-22s. But there are some things I find odd: </p>

<p>(1) If I try to inline <strong><em>rnd512QM</em></strong>, the code takes 4 times longer, but if I inline <strong><em>rnd512PM</em></strong> nothing happens! Why is this happening? These two functions are virtually identical!</p>

<p>(2) This is maybe more difficult. I've been experimenting with executing the two permutations in parallel. But currently to no avail. This is one example of what I tried:</p>

<pre><code>f512 h m = V.force outP `par` (V.force outQ `pseq` (V.zipWith3 xor3 h outP outQ))
   where xor3 x1 x2 x3 = x1 `xor` x2 `xor` x3
         inP = V.zipWith xor h m
         outP = permP inP
         outQ = permQ m
</code></pre>

<p>When checking the run-time statistics, and using ThreadScope, I noticed that the correct number of SPARKS was created, but almost none was actually converted to useful parallel work. Thus I gained nothing in speedup. My question then becomes: </p>

<ol>
<li>Are the P and Q functions just too small for the runtime to bother to run in parallel?</li>
<li>If not, is my use of <strong><em>par</em></strong> and <strong><em>pseq</em></strong> (and possibly Vector.Unboxed.force) wrong?</li>
<li>Would I gain anything by switching to strategies? And how would I go about doing that? </li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>

<p>Sorry for not providing any real benchmark tests. The testing code in the repo was just intended for myself only. For those wanting to test the code out, you will need to compile <a href=""https://github.com/hakoja/SHA3"" rel=""nofollow"">main.hs</a>, and then run it as: </p>

6035975,2D matrix traverse - optimal path memorization,"<p>I have a function that is used to find the optimal path in a 2D matrix (structure of integers, value and sum) but it doesn't memorize optimal values, it only return the minimum cost of the traversal once it gets down to the bottom of the matrix.

6035986,UNION SELECT with multiple distinct criteria where there is no real FK,"<p>I need to select a handfull of items from several tables with one problematic criterium.
There is a meta_data table that contains information about a referred table. Simplified structure:</p>

<pre><code>table quest
id   INT AI PK
id_questtype   INT  FK -&gt; questtype.id
id_creator   INT  FK -&gt; user.id
creationdate   DATETIME
...
</code></pre>

<p>Each id refers to respective table</p>

<pre><code>table user
id   INT AI PK
id_group   INT
username   VARCHAR(255)
...

table questtype
id   INT AI PK
name   VARCHAR(100)
...
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes tricky part:</p>

<pre><code>table  quest_meta
id   INT AI PK
id_quest   INT  FK -&gt; quest.id
id_user   INT  FK -&gt; user.id
id_meta   INT NN
key   VARCHAR(20)
value   LONGTEXT
</code></pre>

<p>This table ""quest_meta"" is used to store all sorts of additional information for each quest item. For example  question 1, question 2 etc.</p>

<pre><code>table participation
id_user   INT  FK -&gt; user.id
id_quest   INT  FK -&gt; quest.id
id_quest_meta   INT NN
</code></pre>

<p>The id_quest_meta refers to quest_meta.id_meta but its not a real FK because there can be multiple rows with the same id_meta in the quest_meta table.</p>

<p>Works all nice and fine until i want to query information join all of those tables and having to fulfill !2! criteria in the participation table.</p>

<p>My current query looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT up.time, qm.value as title, u.username, u.id as id_user, q.id as id_quest
FROM participation p INNER JOIN quests q 
ON p.id_quest = q.id INNER JOIN user u
ON p.id_user = u.id INNER JOIN quest_meta qm
ON q.id = qm.id_quest
WHERE up.time &gt; '2011-08-19 00:00:00' AND qm.key = 'quest_title' AND qm.id_meta = -1
GROUP BY p.id_user
UNION
SELECT p.time, qm.value as title, u.username, u.id as id_user, q.id as id_quest
FROM participation p INNER JOIN quests q 
ON p.id_quest = uq.id INNER JOIN users u
ON p.id_user = u.id INNER JOIN quests_meta qm
ON q.id = qm.id_quest
WHERE p.time &gt; '2011-08-19 00:00:00' AND q.id = 2 AND p.vote = '1' AND p.id_quest_meta = -7
GROUP BY id_user 
ORDER BY time DESC;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for the UNION is, that i need the additional criterium p.vote = '1' 
together with p.id_quest_meta = -7 (this is the quest_meta i know means it should be shown).
So this is what i have...</p>

<p>MY PROBLEM NOW IS: How can i additionally make sure, that FROM 2nd SELECT only rows are selected 
WHERE qm.key = 'quest_title' AND qm.id_quest_meta = -1</p>

<p>Currently i receive a random qm.value from all the rows that are in the participation table.</p>

<p>All tables are InnoDB.
If anything is unclear, ill love to explain whatever details are missing. Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

6035993,In which case should we use the xlsm or the xlsb format?,"<p>This may be a very common issue but I haven't found so far a <em>good</em> answer to this question.</p>

<p>Since Excel 2007, Microsoft has split the classical <code>.xls</code> format to several formats (in particular, <code>.xlsx</code>, <code>.xlsm</code>, <code>.xlsb</code>). I've got no problem to understand the use and purpose of <code>.xlsx</code> format but I am still wondering wether we should use a <code>.xlsm</code> or a <code>.xlsb</code> format when creating a file containing some VBA.</p>

<p>Of course, you can find some topics on the web, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>on <a href=""http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-customize/personalxlsm-vs-personalxlsb/9e45d7e7-dd27-4541-aff7-6c9b830b4496"">Microsoft answers forum</a></li>

</ul>

<p>What I've understood from this last link is that <code>.xlsm</code> is some kind of <em>XML format</em> and thus, needed for custom ribbon tab.</p>

<p>Beyond the <strong>conceptual</strong> difference between the format (<code>.xlsm</code> is based on <em>XML</em> VS <code>.xlsb</code> is a <em>binary</em> file), is there any <strong>practical</strong> difference when using any of this file (apart from the ribbon customization)?<br>
Did you ever see any real difference when using any of these formats?</p>

6035994,Please recommend SIP voicemail software,"<p>My ISP offers some VoIP service which is provided via the same network cable as internet does. The ISP techsupport claims that the only known ways of connection allowing me to use VoIP is such that VoIP phone or VoIP gateway is placed between my computer/router and ISP.</p>

<p>I don't have VoIP phone nor VoIP gateway and want to avoid buying one and pretty sure that I can use offered VoIP service from my PC directly. Probably All I need is the proper VoIP software. I don't know which one will suite me, though.  </p>

<p>I'm using Windows Vista and want to primarily use VoIP service for voice mail (in fact voice mail is the only thing I need, but other features like normal calls can be handy too).  </p>

<p>There are also some parameters which may be important for the software selection:
Speech encoding: G.711a, G.711u, DTMF - RFC2833.</p>

<p>The ISP says what following hardware is recommended for it's VoIP service:</p>

<p>VoIP phones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fanvil BW-210</li>
<li>Zyxel V301-T1</li>
<li>Grandstream BT-100</li>
<li>WellTech LP-388</li>
<li>NSGate 3388</li>

<p>VoIP gateways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grandstream НТ-502</li>
<li>Welltech ATA-172</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> Is there are any software solutions which will suite my needs? If so, which ones?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> AFAIK SIP-phone abilities isn't limited to only outgoing calls and in case of ordinary phone connected to SIP provider via SIP-gateway it's possible to use voice mail feature of the ordinary phone (if that phone have this feature of course). In that case I don't need to use voice mail service from my SIP-provider. If above is correct then I'm pretty sure that I can run some software which will emulate voice mailbox on my PC.</p>

6036018,C++ application - should I use static or dynamic linking for the libraries?,"<p>I am going to start a new C++ project that will rely on a series of libraries, including part of the Boost libraries, the log4cxx or the google logging library - and as the project evolves other ones as well (which I can not yet anticipate).</p>

<p>It will have to run on both 32 and 64 bit systems, most probably in a quite diverse Linux environment where I do not expect to have all the required libraries available nor su privileges. </p>

<p>My question is, should I build my application by dynamically or statically linking to all these libraries?</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>(1) I am aware the static linking might be a pain during development (longer compile times, cross-compiling for both 32 and 64 bit, going down dependency chains to include all libraries, etc), but it's a lot easier during testing - just move the file and run.</p>

<p>(2) On the other hand, dynamic linking seams easier during development phase - short compile times, (don't really know how to handle dynamic linking to 64 bit libraries from my 32 bit dev environment), no hustle with dependency chains. Deployment of new versions on the other hand can be ugly - especially when new libraries are required (see condition above of not having su rights on the targeted machines, nor these libraries available).</p>

<p>(3) I've read the related questions regarding this topic but couldn't really figure out which approach would best fit my scenario.</p>

<p><b> Conclusions: </b></p>

<ol>
<li>Thank you all for your input!</li>
<li>I will probably go with static linking because:</li>
<ul>
<li> Easier deployment </li>
<li> Predictable performance and more consistent results during perf. testing (look at this paper: http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/hauswirth/publications/CU-CS-1042-08.pdf) </li>
<li> As pointed out, the size and duration of compilation of static vs. dynamic does not seem to be such a huge difference </li>
<li> Easier and faster test cycles </li>
<li> I can keep all the dev. cycle on my dev. machine </li>
</ul>

6036029,How StringBuilder can be used to read large text files in Java?,"<p>Is there any mechanism in Java to reduce the memory usage while reading large text files? </p>

<p>Almost every program I've come across uses String to read text files.But Java reserves space for each String literal.That's why I think memory usage gets increased since all String objects are stored. All the classes of java.io deals with String. But if we're not using  StringBuilder then how can we reduce memory usage?</p>

<p>After all reducing memory usage is the primary concern of StringBuilder[since it's not immutable like String]. Then how can we exploit its feature in Java I/O operation without using String i.e. without using something like this:  sb.append([String object]);</p>

6036034,Design review for application facing memory issues,"<p>I apologise in advance for the length of this post, but I want to paint an accurate picture of the problems my app is facing and then pose some questions below;</p>

<p>I am trying to address some self inflicted design pain that is now leading to my application crashing due to out of memory errors. </p>

<p>An abridged description of the <strong>problem domain</strong> is as follows; </p>

<ul>
<li>The application takes in a “dataset” that consists of numerous text files containing related data </li>
<li>An individual text file within the dataset usually contains approx 20 “headers” that contain metadata about the data it contains. It also contains a large tab delimited section containing data that is related to data in one of the other text files contained within the dataset. The number of columns per file is very variable from 2 to 256+ columns.</li>
</ul>

<p>The original application was written to allow users to load a dataset, map certain columns of each of the files which basically indicating key information on the files to show how they are related as well as identify a few expected column names. Once this is done, a validation process takes place to enforce various rules and ensure that all the relationships between the files are valid. Once that is done, the data is imported into a SQL Server database. The database design is an EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) model used to cater for the variable columns per file. I know EAV has its detractors, but in this case, I feel it was a reasonable choice given the disparate data and variable number of columns submitted in each dataset. </p>

<p><strong>The memory problem</strong></p>

<p>Given the fact the combined size of all text files was at most about 5 megs, and in an effort to reduce the database transaction time, it was decided to read ALL the data from files into memory and then perform the following;</p>

<ul>
<li>perform all the validation whilst the data was in memory </li>
<li>relate it using an object model </li>
<li>Start DB transaction and write the key columns row by row, noting the Id of the written row (all tables in the database utilise identity columns), then the Id of the newly written row is applied to all related data </li>
<li>Once all related data had been updated with the key information to which it relates, these records are written using SqlBulkCopy. Due to our EAV model, we essentially have; x columns by y rows to write, where x can by 256+ and rows are often into the tens of thousands. </li>
<li>Once all the data is written without error (can take several minutes for large datasets), Commit the transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem now comes from the fact we are now receiving individual files containing over 30 megs of data. In a dataset, we can receive any number of files. We’ve started seen datasets of around 100 megs coming in and I expect it is only going to get bigger from here on in. With files of this size, data can’t even be read into memory without the app falling over, let alone be validated and imported. I anticipate having to modify large chunks of the code to allow validation to occur by parsing files line by line and am not exactly decided on how to handle the import and transactions. </p>

<p><strong>Potential improvements</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I’ve wondered about using GUIDs to relate the data rather than relying on identity fields. This would allow data to be related prior to writing to the database.  This would certainly increase the storage required though. Especially in an EAV design. Would you think this is a reasonable thing to try, or do I simply persist with identity fields (natural keys can’t be trusted to be unique across all submitters). </li>
<li>Use of staging tables to get data into the database and only performing the transaction to copy data from staging area to actual destination tables.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For systems like this that import large quantities of data, how to you go about keeping transactions small. I’ve kept them as small as possible in the current design, but they are still active for several minutes and write hundreds of thousands of records in one transaction. Is there a better solution? </li>
<li>The tab delimited data section is read into a DataTable to be viewed in a grid. I don’t need the full functionality of a DataTable, so I suspect it is overkill. Is there anyway to turn off various features of DataTables to make them more lightweight? </li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any other obvious things you would do in this situation to minimise the memory footprint of  the application described above? </p>

<p>Thanks for your kind attention.</p>

There are two tables that relates to each other in a <em>one to many</em> relationship: Claim and ClaimDetail. The designer automatically creates a function GetClaimDetailRows which returns all ClaimDetailRows  for a ClaimRow. <strong>Why is this Array's length always 0?</strong>
Because ClaimDetail contains more than 40 Million rows, i did'nt fill it before i call GetClaimDetailRows but had configured it's selectcommand that it takes a parameter idData to fill only the related records.  But that seems not to work because the  ClaimDetail-Datatable is empty. </p>

Do i have to fill the Claimdetail-Datatable first(ClearBeforeFill=True) for each Claim? But then i dont need to use this function anymore.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I now fill the Datatable(ClearBeforeFill=True)before i call the Child-function and it works. But i dont understand why it could not throw an exception(optionally) when i try to acess a child-relation without having that datatable being filled(at least with 0 rows). Instead of that it returns 0 rows what can be correct or incorrect and is difficult to detect. Is this a lack of design or am i missing something? </p>

6036071,How to find if a function hasn't been called?,"<p>I am working on an Android application and I just want to know when a function hasn't been called. For example, lets say you have the function </p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
 ...//do something here;
}

<p>What I want to do is time if the function hasn't been called for lets say, 10 seconds, and then record the time after that 10 seconds. After that, if the function is invoked and it is called, I want to record the time when it function begins again. I was thinking of using the Timer function but I wasn't exactly sure on how to test whether or not a function has been invoked.</p>

<p>I am working on an application in which you see whether or not a person starts or stops walking. For example, if someone has stopped walking for 10 seconds, I want to record that time. When they resume walking, I also want to record that time. Hope this makes better sense. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>After all the reading and troubleshooting I've done, I have learned that this error surfaces when Python and MySQL are not running on the same architecture. Since I have the 64-bit version of MySQL, I can remove the environment variable I put in .bashrc that sets the preference to the 32-bit version of Python (export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes) and the MySQLdb import works. However, I then get the following error when importing cx_Oracle:</p>

<p>When diving into this rabbit hole I find conflicting information about what I have set-up for cx_Oracle, what needs 32-bit architecture and what needs 64-bit tracing all the way back to my Oracle installation. I've encountered the segmentation fault error, the libclntsh.dylib error and the clang error etc. Perhaps, at this point, the information overload has sent me in circles so long that I can't clearly see the solution? But I know there has to be a way...</p>

6036076,How can I delay a ASP.NET AutoPostBack so JavaScript fires first?,"<p>I've got an odd situation with a text box and an autocomplete setup on my page. I'm using a JQuery based autocomplete on a text box that has AutoPostBack=""True"". This works perfect if I use the keyboard to select an autocomplete item, which then fires Jquery to fill in the text box, and then when I tab out of the box the AutoPostBack fires. If, however, I click on an autocomplete item, my text box loses focus first and the AutoPostBack fires before the Jquery has a chance to change the text in my text box. Is there a way to delay either the PostBack or the Jquery so that they don't fight each other? I'm thinking it may have to be the PostBack that gets changed, since the JQuery would lose it's state on the PostBack. Any suggestions?</p>

6036078,Printing dynamically created WindowsFormsHost in WPF,"<p>I'm trying to print a WindowsFormsHost in a WPF application.
It prints ok, if the WindowsFormsHost object is created by xaml, but it prints an empty page if I create WindowsFormsHost in code.</p>

<p><strong>How do I have to create WindowsFormsHost object in code in order to get it to printout?</strong></p>

<p>Here is the simplified but working code:</p>

<pre><code>            PrintDialog dialog = new PrintDialog();
            if (dialog.ShowDialog() == true)
            {
                System.Windows.Forms.TextBox ctrl = new System.Windows.Forms.TextBox();
                ctrl.Text = ""Test"";
                ctrl.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Red;
#if RUNTIME
                WindowsFormsHost wfh = new WindowsFormsHost();
                wfh.Child = ctrl;
                FrameworkElement visual = wfh;

                visual.Arrange(new Rect(0, 0, dialog.PrintableAreaWidth, dialog.PrintableAreaHeight));

                dialog.PrintVisual(visual, ""Test"");
            }
</code></pre>

<p>This code prints the TextBox only when RUNTIME is not defined.
If RUNTIME is defined it prints an empty page.

6036080,Java: Strings generated by substring not treated as hard coded strings,"<p>Dear all, I'm making a simple file decoder for Android 2.2 that needs to find the filename of the encoded file from a header. This filename should then be used as the filename for the decoded file (as you would expect).</p>

<p>The filename is identified by the substring <code>name=</code>, so the actual name starts 5 places after that. The line is read by a BufferedReader and temporarily stored in <code>currLine</code>.</p>

<p>For some reason I can't understand nor find on the web, Strings do not always seem to be Strings...</p>

System.out.println(""fileOutName contains: ""+ fileOutName);<br>
  System.out.println(""fileOutName type: ""+ fileOutName.getClass());</code>  </p>

<p>It works like it should. However reading it from the file does not work:</p>

<p><code>String fileOutName = currLine.substring((currLine.indexOf(""name="")+5));</code></p>

<p>Gives no output file, nor an IO exception. The string is parsed properly though: from the System.out debugging lines I find for both cases:  </p>

fileOutName type: class java.lang.String</code></p>

<p>Anyone have any clue as to why this would not work? :S</p>

6036081,Matplotlib/pyplot: How to enforce axis range?,"<p>I would like to draw a standard 2D line graph with pylot, but force the axes' values to be between 0 and 600 on the x, and 10k and 20k on the y.  Let me go with an example...</p>

<pre><code>import pylab as p

p.title(save_file)
p.axis([0.0,600.0,1000000.0,2000000.0])

#define keys and items elsewhere..
p.plot(keys,items)
p.savefig(save_file, dpi=100)

<p>However, the axes still adjust to the size of the data.  I'm interpreting the effect of p.axis to be setting what the max and min could be, not enforcing them to be the max or min.  The same happens when I try to use p.xlim() etc.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

6036082,Shroud of Turin -- is it absolutely and definitively debunked?,"<p>A little <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin"">context</a> on this famous myth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Shroud of Turin or Turin Shroud is a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion.<br>
  Some contend that the shroud is the actual cloth placed on the body of Jesus Christ at the time of his burial, and that the face image is the Holy Face of Jesus, while others contend that the artefact was created in the Middle Ages, as indicated by carbon dating which placed the artifact between 1260 and 1390.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the JREF <a href=""http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Shroud%20of%20Turin.html"">claims</a> that this particular myth is absolutely debunked. I completely agree that the shroud has not, and will never, be proven to be a genuine holy item - how could one prove that it was used on Jesus of Nazareth at all? </p>

<p>On the other hand, the way the myth is debunked is, in my view, flaky, weak and unconvincing. Here in short are the claims, after each my doubts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The cloth itself could not date from the correct period or from that area of the world, simply because that particular weave of cloth was not made then or there.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot find any good source to verify this. In any case I don't see how we can easily make such assertion (it could be an uncommon type with few examples left).</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Wrapping of a body in that size and shape of cloth was not done in Palestine at that period. Such wrapping disagrees with the biblical description as well.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is completely irrelevant - either the cloth is from that place and time or it isn't. It could have been an unusual choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The representation of the face of Christ on this cloth and in all paintings and sculptures is and always has been a formalized guess. This version matches the “accepted” one. We know nothing about Christ's actual appearance.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also totally irrelevant - the fact that Jesus has been depicted as a hippy guy with a beard does not rule out or confirm anything about his appearance (if he existed).</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Carbon dating of the fabric, done in three independent labs, showed that the linen fabric was woven about the year 1350.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>True, but there are claims that the results might have been obtained by medieval repairs instead that from an original part of the cloth. The areas that have been cut off were the worst kept in order not to destroy important parts of the cloth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The “bloodstains” are not only red in color (they could not be, after that period of time), but they were shown by chemical analysis to be paint of the composition used in the fourteenth century.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot find any real affirmative confirmation of this claim - I can only find claims that someone made paint of the same color as the shroud, but no confirmation that ""chemical analysis"" has been performed on the shroud at all. Wikipedia, for what is worth, has a totally different story on the matter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The bishop of Troyes (Lirey) knew who the artist was who painted the cloth and when and how he did it, and so reported to Pope Clement VII. The document still exists and has been shown to be unquestionably authentic.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is shaky evidence - it's hearsay.</p>

<p>The question is the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is the JREF correct when they affirm that <code>Definitive tests prove absolutely that it is a forgery</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

6036084,Farm Solution Vs. SandBox,"<p>I have developed a portal and we have integrated with Oracle E-Business Suite. In this project we have complex form requirements so I developed custom aspx forms mainly master-detail forms and lots of complex code behind code due to its nature which seemed not possible in OOTB as we have standard edition and don't have INFOPATH.</p>

<p>we have developed visual webparts (custom aspx forms) and deployed as farm solution. Now I need to learn Sandbox thingy.

6036087,How to prevent small values from being plotted with nodes near coords?,"<p>I'm trying to finalize my first <code>pgfplots</code> chart. I've managed to get is almost the way I would like it to be with thanks to all examples I found here.
The last thing I can't seem to figure out is how to prevent plotting of value labels below 4% as they don't fit the bar (and small percentages aren't really relevant in this specific case).
I've found an example here on how to suppress the text from showing when the value is 0. I feel that it's just a small step to getting it to work. What I tried was to use <code>\pgfmathfloatifflags</code> and test for negative numbers on <code>\pgfplotspointmeta</code> minus 4. Would this work? I've not gotten it to work. I believe my understanding of the semantics of TeX/PGF is not adequate.</p>

<p>The result so far:
I tried to post an image here but as a new user I'm not allowed. Let me describe the issue: One data point has value 2. The bar segment of this data point is too small for the value to be plotted inside bar segment. It's overlapping now with another value. I would like small values to not be plotted in the chart.</p>

6036111,NTFS hard disk now recognized as 'RAW',"<p>My Windows XP was recently corrupted and my hard disk was password protected. In an effort to retrieve my old info I slaved my hard disk to a friends PC.</p>

<p>I changed the permissions on my old, slaved drive and all was well. I then installed a secondary 250 GB slave so I could backup the data on his 'D:' (primary slave) drive, which he promised to me after I was done.</p>

<p>Then, when I uninstalled my old drive, his primary slave was no longer present in 'My Computer'. I removed the new 250 GB drive, but his primary slave was still not visible. </p>

<p>I did a little research and found that I could reassign the drive letter to make it visible via the disk manager and reassigned the 'D:' designation. The drive is now visible, but it says that the disk is unformatted, which is obviously not true.</p>

<p>How can I rectify this without formatting the drive? </p>
"
6036112,Time left before scheduled shutdown?,"<p>Is there any way to view how much time is left before a scheduled shutdown in Windows 7?</p>

<p>By scheduled shutdown I mean a shutdown (or restart) scheduled using the command line <code>shutdown.exe</code> application, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>shutdown /t 600 /s
</code></pre>

<p>That would pop up a message box saying there are 10 minutes until shutdown, and the actual system time of shutdown.</p>

<p>Any time longer than <code>600</code> seconds uses a balloon message instead.</p>

<p>I vaguely recall XP providing a GUI progress monitor, with a countdown.</p>

<p>How did they work? The shutdown time left or scheduled time must be stored somewhere, how can I access this? </p>

<p>My preference is some method through the command line (i.e. non-GUI). More importantly, is this accomplishable within Windows, i.e. without any third party programs?</p>

<p>If this is not accomplishable with standard Windows utilities (and I'm bordering on Stack Overflow territory here), is there a Windows API (or .NET, which could even be used in PowerShell!) function? Either would be preferred over some random third party program.</p>

6036121,Large SVN repository on USB 3.0 key - how to speed up and simplify?,"<p>There are a few existing questions regarding the best practices about how to check out a version controlled-repository to a USB key.  <strong><em>But those questions were before USB 3.0 came out.</em></strong>  For reasons technical, USB-spec and cost-related, USB 2.0 thumbdrive performance is surprisingly dismal for small files.  Since we're using a centralized version control system (Subversion), checking out to some sort of portable drive is the best workflow we came up with for working off-line.</p>

<p>Our repository is about 280MB, ~6,000 files.  We never let it complete checking out to the USB 2.0 keys because it would take too long (especially when you're trying to leave for the day -- hour+?).  We tried creating a .zip file of the repository but then unzipping would take even longer.</p>

<p>Anyhow, fast-forward to USB3 and things are vastly improved.  With a 32GB USB3.0 drive the repository takes about 4:30 to check out completely.  I am happy to report that it is finally ""reasonable"" to work on a USB key with a 3.0 drive and 3.0 card.</p>

<p><strong>Question: are there other workflow changes that can help make this simpler and/or faster?</strong></p>

<p>I have seen suggestions for using Bazaar, Git, etc. (i.e. a distributed version control system) as merely a front-end interface to SVN so that you can have your repository-and-all-its-great-glory on-the-go and:</p>

<p>A) reduce the size of the ""SVN checkout..."" operation</p>

<p>B) speed up the update/commit operation</p>

<p>C) continue working alongside other TortoiseSVN&lt;->SVN Server users in happiness</p>

<p>But I am not sure if this will make checkouts any faster.  Granted, now that the repository is checked out it's only a matter of smaller sets of changed files.  <em>But checking out an entire Branch is still an issue.</em></p>

6036144,How to know when a set of RabbitMQ tasks are complete?,"<p>I am using RabbitMQ to have worker processes encode video files. I would like to know when all of the files are complete - that is, when all of the worker processes have finished.</p>

<p>The only way I can think to do this is by using a database. When a video finishes encoding:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE videos SET status = 'complete' WHERE filename = 'foo.wmv'
-- etc etc etc as each worker finishes --
</code></pre>

<p>And then to check whether or not all of the videos have been encoded:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(*) FROM videos WHERE status != 'complete'
</code></pre>

<p>But if I'm going to do this, then I feel like I am losing the benefit of RabbitMQ as a mechanism for multiple distributed worker processes, since I still have to manually maintain a database queue.</p>

<p>Is there a standard mechanism for RabbitMQ dependencies? That is, a way to say ""wait for these 5 tasks to finish, and once they are done, then kick off a new task?""</p>

<p>I don't want to have a parent process add these tasks to a queue and then ""wait"" for each of them to return a ""completed"" status. Then I have to maintain a separate process for each group of videos, at which point I've lost the advantage of decoupled worker processes as compared to a single ThreadPool concept.</p>

<p>Am I asking for something which is impossible? Or, are there standard widely-adopted solutions to manage the overall state of tasks in a queue that I have missed?</p>

<p>Edit: after searching, I found this similar question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5870511/getting-result-of-a-long-running-task-with-rabbitmq"">Getting result of a long running task with RabbitMQ</a></p>

<p>Are there any particular thoughts that people have about this?</p>

<p>So, clearly, I'm leaking connections somewhere, but I can't figure out where. I've been looking for sources that tell me how to get from a connection ID to a Unix process ID, but most of the approaches expect the connections to be from remote servers, allowing you to use netstat to debug them. Either that, or they require you to modify your codebase to log each attempted connection, which seems a little like overkill.</p>

<p>So... are there any approaches that anyone knows of? Any files that this sleeping connection will have open, so that I can use fuser, for instance? Or... is it possible that these are zombie connections that have no owning process?</p>

6036165,Restart an animated GIF from JavaScript without reloading the image,"<p>I am creating a slideshow of animations using animated GIFs. I'm crossfading from one animation to the next. The problem is: the only way I have discovered to ensure that the GIF starts animating from the first frame is to reload it each time it's shown. The GIFs are 200KB or so each, which is way too much bandwidth for a continuous slideshow.</p>

<p>Here's my current code. <code>img</code> and <code>nextimg</code> are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags containing a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> each. <code>nextimg_img</code> is the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag corresponding to the next image to be displayed.</p>

<pre><code>var tmp = nextimg_img.attr('src');
nextimg_img.attr('src', '');
setTimeout(function() { nextimg_img.attr('src', tmp); }, 0);
img.fadeOut('slow');
nextimg.fadeIn('slow');
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that it sets the <code>src</code> attribute of the next image to <code>''</code>, then sets it back to the source of the GIF to be displayed.</p>

<p>This works &mdash; it restarts the animation from the beginning &mdash; but the GIFs seem to be redownloaded every time they are displayed.</p>

6036186,Getting result of a long running task with RabbitMQ,"<p>I have a scenario where a client sends an http request to download a file. The file needs to be dynamically generated and typically takes 5-15 seconds. Therefore I am looking into a solution that splits this operation in 3 http requests.</p>

<ol>
<li>First request triggers the generation of the file. </li>
<li>The client polls the server every 5 seconds to check if file is ready to download</li>
<li>When the response to the poll request is positive, the client starts downloading the file </li>
</ol>

<p>To implement this I am looking into Message Queue solutions like RabbitMQ. They seem to provide a reliable framework to run long running tasks asynchronously. However after reading the <a href=""http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a> on RabbitMQ, I am not sure how will I receive the result of the operation.</p>

<p>Here is what I've in mind:</p>

<p>A front end server receives requests from clients and it posts messages to RabbitMQ as required. This front end server will have 3 endpoints</p>

<pre><code>/generate
/poll
/download
</code></pre>

<p>When client invokes <code>/generate</code> with a <code>GET</code> parameter say <code>request_uid=AAA</code>, the front end server will post a message to RabbitMQ with the request_uid in the payload. Any free worker will subsequently receive this message and start generating the file corresponding to <code>AAA</code>.</p>

<p>Client will keep polling <code>/poll</code> with <code>request_uid=AAA</code> to check if task was complete.</p>

<p>When task is complete client will call <code>/download</code> with <code>request_uid=AAA</code> expecting to download the file. </p>

<p>The question is how will the <code>/poll</code> and <code>/download</code> handlers of the front end server will come to know about the status of the file generation job? How can RabbitMQ communicate the result of the task back to the producer. Or do I have to implement such mechanism outside RabbitMQ? (Consumer putting its results in a file <code>/var/completed/AAA</code>)</p>

6036188,Android IntentService time limit,"<p>I'm writing an app that is required to poll a web page at a user configurable frequency.  I have an AlarmManager set up with a broadcast pending intent.  When the Alarm goes off, my broadcast receiver triggers an IntentService which then fetches the web page.  </p>

<p>In the emulator this works fine but on my device with a slow data connection (GPRS) it takes longer than the alarm interval for the intent service to execute.  From reading the documentation I understand that the Intents will queue up and be processed serially which means the work will never get done.</p>

<p>Is there an elegant solution to this?  I was thinking I could either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check the IntentService queue is empty before adding more work.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of time that can be spent in onHandleIntent.</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, I'm struggling to find a standard method to achieve what I want.</p>

6036197,Centralizing CloudStorageAccount and TableServiceContext instances,"<p>In an ASP.NET MVC 3 Web Role, I have realized that I have been writing the below code a lot:</p>

    CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue(""DataConnectionString"")
    );

var ctx = 
    account.CreateCloudTableClient().GetDataServiceContext();
</code></pre>

<p>So, I decided to Centralize this for the entire ASP.NET MVC application and I created the below class with static properties:</p>

<pre><code>internal class WindowsAzureStorageContext {

    public static CloudStorageAccount StorageAccount { 

        get {
            return
                CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
                    RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue(""DataConnectionString"")
                );
        }
    }

    public static TableServiceContext TableServiceCtx { 
        get {

            return
                StorageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient().GetDataServiceContext();
        } 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, I am using this as below inside my controllers:</p>

<pre><code>public class HomeController : Controller {

    private readonly TableServiceContext ctx = 
        WindowsAzureStorageContext.TableServiceCtx;

    public ViewResult Index() {

        var model = ctx.CreateQuery&lt;TaskEntity&gt;(Constants.TASKS_TABLE).
            Where(x =&gt; x.PartitionKey == string.Empty);

        return View(model);
    }

    public ViewResult Create() {
        return View();
    }

    [ActionName(""Create"")]
    [HttpPost, ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public ViewResult Create_post(TaskEntity taskEntity) {

        ctx.AddObject(Constants.TASKS_TABLE, new TaskEntity(taskEntity.Task));
        ctx.SaveChangesWithRetries();

        return RedirectToAction(""Index"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know that this is not a unit test friendly and I should reach out that <code>TableServiceContext</code> instance through a interface by DI but when I do that, I consider using this <code>WindowsAzureStorageContext</code> class as well to get an instance of <code>TableServiceContext</code> class.</p>

<p>Is this a good practice? Would it hurt me in any point because I am using the same class for the entire application life-cycle?</p>

6036200,CAPM-model - necessary conditions for BETA to be a parameter in the conditional expectation,"<p>CAPM-model - necessary conditions for BETA to be a parameter in the conditional expectation between the real return on the asset and the stock market return.</p>

<p>Okay, trying to be more explicit:
Let $\mu_{at}$ denote the total required rate of return on an asset in period $t$. The capital pricing model (CAPM) states that: 
$\mu _{at}=r_t+\phi _t \sigma _a \rho _{am}$
where $r_t$ is a riskless interest rate in time period $t$. $\phi_t$ is an aggregated market parameter. $\sigma_a$ and $\rho_{am}$ are parameters if the joint probability density function $f(r_{at},r_{mt})$ of the return on an individual asset ($r_{at})$ and the stock market return ($r_{mt})$. $\sigma_a$ is the standard deviation of the real return on the asset, and $\rho_{am}$ is the correlation between $r_{at}, r_{mt}$. The rest is now explained below (I do not know if there's more information you need? I don't have more information.)</p>

<p>I have the model $\mu _{at}=r_t+\phi _t \sigma _a \rho _{am}$. And as you probably know, this can be rewritten such that:</p>

<p>$\mu_{at}=r_t+(E(r_{mt})-r_t){\sigma_{am}}/{\sigma_m^2}$ in the case where $\phi_t=({E(r_{mt})-r_t})/{\sigma_m}$</p>

<p>Now let $\beta_a^{CAPM} \equiv {\sigma_{am}}/{\sigma_m^2}$</p>

<p>What I am supposed to find out is this: Under which sufficient assumption(s) is $\beta_a^{CAPM}$ a parameter in the conditional expectation function $E(r_{at}|r_{mt})$? Explain. </p>

<p>I know this has to do with the normal distribution and the pdf of a bivariate normal distribution, but I'm not sure I catch all the points, so if you guys know the drill, I would be delighted. </p>

6036205,"Given a number X, estimate where in an ordered list of primes that number may fall","<p>Given a pre-calculated ordered list of primes, and a supplied number X, I want to estimate roughly where X would fall in the list of primes, and start searching at that point.</p>

<p>So, I have calculated and stored a list of primes from 1..2^32-1, in a binary file.  I've got methods in a program that runs against that file to give me the nth prime, a random prime, how many primes exist, etc.  But in order to add a function to this program to tell me where a supplied number is prime, I am having trouble coming up with a way to estimate where to begin searching.  Doing it the naïve O(n) method quickly becomes infeasible, even for numbers &lt; 2^32.</p>

<p>I've tried the Prime Number Theorem's (x/ln x), and done research in some other areas, but haven't quite found the right distribution, and I'm afraid my number theory isn't up to par.</p>

<p>I'm looking for something like, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4  5  6 .. 100 ..  500 .. 1000 ..  5000 ..  10000
2 3 5 7 11 13 .. 541 .. 3571 .. 7919 .. 48611 .. 104729
</code></pre>

<p>So, lookup(13) would give me a number near, but &lt;= 6, lookup(7920) would give me a number &lt;= 1000, and lookup(104729) would give a number &lt;= 10000, etc.</p>

<p>P.S. I realize this is a stupid method for several reasons: a) I could store it in a different way and have O(1) lookups; b) I could compress the storage substantially; c) for such small numbers, I could do a prime test on the given number at runtime, skip the lookup table entirely, and it would be faster.  I'm <em>not interested in solutions for these issues</em>; I <em>genuinely want to know if there is a proven method of estimating where in a sorted list of primes a given number may fall</em>.  Hence, this is more a mathematical/number-theory question than an implementation question.</p>

<p>P.P.S. It's not homework.</p>

<p>P.P.P.S. I did a pretty thorough search on StackOverflow, but may have missed a direct answer to this.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"
6036235,Storing the state of a complex object with Memento pattern (and Command),"<p>I'm working on a small UML editor project, in Java, that I started a couple of months ago. After a few weeks, I got a working copy for a UML class diagram editor.</p>

<p>But now, I'm redesigning it completely to support other types of diagrams, such a sequence, state, class, etc. This is done by implementing a graph construction framework (I'm greatly inspired by Cay Horstmann work on the subject with the Violet UML editor).</p>

<p>Redesign was going smoothly until one of my friends told me that I forgot to add a Do/Undo functionnality to the project, which, in my opinion, is vital.</p>

<p>Remembering object oriented design courses, I immediately thought of Memento and Command pattern.</p>

<p>Here's the deal. I have a abstract class, AbstractDiagram, that contains two ArrayLists : one for storing nodes (called Elements in my project) and the other for storing Edges (called Links in my projects).  The diagram will probably keep a stack of commands that can be Undoed/Redoed. Pretty standard.</p>

<p>How can I execute these commands in a efficient way? Say, for example, that I want to move a node (the node will be an interface type named INode, and there will be concrete nodes derived from it (ClassNode, InterfaceNode, NoteNode, etc.)). </p>

<p>The position information is held as an attribute in the node, so by modying that attribute in the node itself, the state is changed. When the display will be refreshed, the node will have moved. This is the Memento part of the pattern (I think), with the difference that the object is the state itself.</p>

<p>Moreover, if I keep a clone of the original node (before it moved), I can get back to its old version. The same technique applies for the information contained in the node (the class or interface name, the text for a note node, the attributes name, and so on).</p>

<p>The thing is, how do I replace, in the diagram, the node with its clone upon undo/redo operation? If I clone the original object that is referenced by the diagram (being in the node list), the clone isn't reference in the diagram, and the only thing that points to is the Command itself! Shoud I include mechanisms in the diagram for finding a node according to an ID (for example) so I can replace, in the diagram, the node by its clone (and vice-versa) ? Is it up to the Memento and Command patterns to do that ? What about links? They should be movable too but I don't want to create a command just for links (and one just for nodes), and I should be able to modify the right list (nodes or links) according to the type of the object the command is referring to.</p>

<p>How would you proceed? In short, I am having trouble representing the state of an object in a command/memento pattern so that it can be efficiently recovered and the original object restored in the diagram list, and depending on the object type (node or link).</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Guillaume.</p>

<p>P.S.: if I'm not clear, tell me and I will clarify my message (as always!).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Here's my actual solution, that I started implementing before posting this question.</p>

<p>First, I have an AbstractCommand class defined as follow :</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class AbstractCommand {
    public boolean blnComplete;

    public void setComplete(boolean complete) {
     this.blnComplete = complete;
    }

    public boolean isComplete() {
     return this.blnComplete;
    }

    public abstract void execute();
    public abstract void unexecute();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, each type of command is implemented using a concrete derivation of AbstractCommand.</p>

<p>So I have a command to move an object :</p>

<pre><code>public class MoveCommand extends AbstractCommand {
    Moveable movingObject;
    Point2D startPos;
    Point2D endPos;

    public MoveCommand(Point2D start) {
     this.startPos = start;
    }

    public void execute() {
     if(this.movingObject != null &amp;&amp; this.endPos != null)
      this.movingObject.moveTo(this.endPos);
    }

    public void unexecute() {
     if(this.movingObject != null &amp;&amp; this.startPos != null)
      this.movingObject.moveTo(this.startPos);
    }

    public void setStart(Point2D start) {
     this.startPos = start;
    }

    public void setEnd(Point2D end) {
     this.endPos = end;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also have a MoveRemoveCommand (to... move or remove an object/node). If I use the ID of instanceof method, I don't have to pass the diagram to the actual node or link so that it can remove itself from the diagram (which is a bad idea I think).</p>

<p>AbstractDiagram diagram;
    Addable obj;
    AddRemoveType type;</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""unused"")
private AddRemoveCommand() {}

public AddRemoveCommand(AbstractDiagram diagram, Addable obj, AddRemoveType type) {
 this.diagram = diagram;
 this.obj = obj;
 this.type = type;
}

public void execute() {
 if(obj != null &amp;&amp; diagram != null) {
  switch(type) {
   case ADD:
    this.obj.addToDiagram(diagram);
    break;
   case REMOVE:
    this.obj.removeFromDiagram(diagram);
    break;
  }
 }
}

public void unexecute() {
 if(obj != null &amp;&amp; diagram != null) {
  switch(type) {
   case ADD:
    this.obj.removeFromDiagram(diagram);
    break;
   case REMOVE:
    this.obj.addToDiagram(diagram);
    break;
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I have a ModificationCommand which is used to modify the info of a node or link (class name, etc.). This may be merged in the future with the MoveCommand. This class is empty for now. I will probably do the ID thing with a mechanism to determine if the modified object is a node or an edge (via instanceof or a special denotion in the ID).</p>

<p>Is this is a good solution?</p>

6036249,Using a certain theorem to calculate the number of stacks cards with the same color.,"<p>Consider the following theorem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $A$ be a set of size $n$. Then there are
  $\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\cdot\ldots\cdot k_{t}!}$ ways to partition this set
  into $t$ nonempty set of sizes $k_{i}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And consider the following example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are $36$ cards, with half of them being blue and half being
  black. These cards are shuffled and then divided into two equal stacks
  of $18$ cards. One has to determine the probability that in both
  stacks there is the same number of blue and black cards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is: How can this example by solved <em>with the above theorem</em>
? </p>

<p>The answer is $\frac{\binom{18}{9}\binom{18}{9}}{\binom{36}{18}}$ - but I got to it with
 my own solution which doesn't use the above theorem, which bothers me, since in
the notes I'm reading, this example comes as a <em>direct application</em> of
the above theorem.</p>

<hr>

<p>For anyone who cares, heres my solution: If the number
of blue and black cards has to be identical in both stacks, we have
to have $9$ blue and $9$ black cards in both decks. Since there
are $18$ blue and $18$ black cards totally, there are $\binom{18}{9}\binom{18}{9}$
possibilities for one stack. But if we select one stack, the other
is automatically determined, so there are actually $\binom{18}{9}\binom{18}{9}$
possibilities to select both stacks. Since totally there are $\binom{36}{18}$ ways
to divide the cards into arbitrary stacks of the same size, we get the answer). </p>

6036252,How to register a 32-bit .DLL COM+ application on Windows 2008 R2,"<p>I have read through all the similar questions but am not finding my exact problem answered. I have tried all the similar recommendations.</p>

<p>I am forced to migrate from a Windows Server 2003 environment to a Windows Server 2008 R2 environment running IIS 7.5.  I have a web application that calls COM objects in a 32-bit DLL.  The COM object was created from VB6.  Here is what I have done to date:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have enabled 32-bit on my IIS Application Pool.</li>
<li>I have registered the .DLL and it's dependent .DLL using C:/windows/syswow64/regsvr32.exe -- the registration is successful.</li>
<li>I have verified that the .DLL and it's components are found in the registry using C:/windows/syswow64/regedit</li>
<li>I have created a COM+ object in Component Services (using syswow64/dcomcnfg) and started them.</li>
<li>I have created a role ""Users"" and added the group 'Everyone' to it.</li>
</ol>

<p>When I run my application the web page hangs.  I can find the following error in the COM object's log file:</p>

<p>""ActiveX component can't create object
  Error: [429]: CDataAdministrator::OpenCatalog""</p>

<p>I have compared the setup between the new server and the old server.  One thing that I notice is that on the old server, the DataAdministrator object (DataAdministrator.CDataAdministrator) is listed under the expansion of DCOM Config, but on the new server it is not.  And I cannot seem to get it to show up there.</p>

<p>I have no errors in the event history or in IIS web logs.  To me it appears that everything is registered, but it won't run.  I can see a DLLHOST.EXE*32 in the task manager running under the account that I specified.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss here.... help?</p>

6036253,Need to find the recurrence equation for coloring a 1 by n chessboard,"<p>So the question asks me to find the number of ways H[n]  to color a 1 by n chessboard with 3 colors - red, blue and white such that the number of red squares is even and number of blue squares is at least one. I am doing it in this way -</p>

<p>1.If the first square is white then the remaining n-1 squares can be colored in H[n-1] ways. </p>

<p>2.If the first square is red then another red will be needed in the n-1 remaining squares and the rest n-2 can be colored in H[n-2] ways. (i.e (n-1)*H[n-2])</p>

<p>3.And now is the problem with blue. If I put blue in the first square and say that the rest n-1 squares can be colored in H[n-1] ways that will be wrong as I already have a blue and may not need any more(while H[n-1] requires one blue at least).
I thought of adding H'[n-1] to H[n] = H[n-1] + (n-1)*H[n-2] which gives
H[n] = H[n-1] + (n-1)*H[n-2] + H'[n-1] where H'[n] is the number of ways to fill n squares with no blue squares(so H'[n] = (n-1)*H'[n-2] + H'[n-1]).
So now I'm kind of really confused how to solve such an equation -></p>

<p>H[n] = H[n-1] + (n-1)*H[n-2] + H'[n-1]. (I am specifically asked not to use exponential generating function to solve problem).</p>

6036257,COM surrogate for third party component,"<p>I'm writing a small DLL component that needs to access two third party components to combine data, one of which is 32 bit only and the other is 64 bit only. Both are registered with a TypeLib and are Automation compatible, so marshalling should not be an issue.</p>

<p>If I understood the documentation correctly, then there is no way to force loading in a surrogate unless the component also has an AppID and the DllSurrogate key; since both are third party components, I'm somewhat reluctant to modify their registration.</p>

<p>Is there a way to activate an object in a component without an AppID in a surrogate process from a DLL component that ideally does not have any extra dependencies, or can anyone explain to me why this would be a bad idea?</p>

6036266,Display: Table-cell not setting height constantly xbrowser (ie8 table bug),"<p>So I'm setting up a page with a bunch of dynamic content. I'm organizing this within a table. There are three rows, each with a single cell. The top part works as a fixed header, since I've set the top cell's height. The bottom cell works as a footer, since it also has a static height. The table's total height is set to 100% and the middle row/cell is left to be filled with dynamic content and the remaining space in the table. Here is a two-rowed example to demonstrate the problem:</p>

<p>or</p>

// e.g. button1#hover#Ok
</code></pre>

<p>where in the second variant, a default font and size is being assumed.</p>

<p>Before you read further, I have to point out that I control the format, so  I'd love to hear about any other format that is more RegExp Friendly&trade;. That being said, the second alternative is needed for historical reasons, as is the <code>id#state#</code>-part. In other words, the flexibility resides in the <code>{font name, font size, ""text""}</code>-part. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I'd like to use RegExp as far as possible. Yes, the RegExp I suggest below is pretty hairy, but for my case this is not only a possible solution to the problem at hand but also a matter of learning more about RegExp itself.</p>

<p>My current attempt at grouping the three or alternatively five information elements in the two formats is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>var pat = /^(\w*)#(\w*)#
          (?:(?:\{([\w\.]*),\s*([0-9\.]*),\s*""([\w\s]*)""\})|([\w\s]*))$/;

var source1 = ""button1#hover#{arial.ttf, 20, \""Ok\""}"";
var source2 = ""button1#hover#Ok"";

var result1 = source1.match ( pat );
var result2 = source2.match ( pat );

alert ( ""Source1: "" + result1.length + "" Source2: "" + result2.length );
</code></pre>

<p>When I tested this expression at <a href=""http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html</a>, I got:</p>

            20, Ok, undefined ]
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>result2 = [ button1#hover#Ok, button1, hover, undefined, 
            undefined, undefined, Ok ]
</code></pre>

<p>Here's how I break down the RegExp:</p>

<pre><code>^(\w*)#(\w*)#(?:(?:\{([\w\.]*),\s*([0-9\.]*),\s*""([\w\s]*)""\})|([\w\s]*))$

^                 # anchor to beginning of string
(\w*)             # capture required id
#                 # match hash sign separator
(\w*)             # capture required state
#                 # match hash sign separator
                  # capture text structure with optional part:
(?:(?:\{([\w\.]*),\s*([0-9\.]*),\s*""([\w\s]*)""\})|([\w\s]*))  
$                 # anchor to end of string
</code></pre>

<p>The text structure capture is the dodgiest part, I guess. I break it down as follows:</p>

<pre><code>(?:                  # match all of what follows but don't capture
    (?:\{            # match left curly bracket but don't capture (non-capturing group)
          ([\w\.]*)  # capture font name (with possible punctuation in font file name)

<p>2) How can I avoid the three undefined matches in the middle of the result2 case?</p>

<p>I would like to extract the element numbers only (20004, 20013 etc.) and write these to a new file. The reading of the file should end as soon as the line (=========) is reached, as there are more element numbers with the same heading later on in the file.
Hope that makes sense.
Any advice much appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p>thanks for all the help!
I now have this code, which gives me a list of the numbers, maximum 10 in a row:</p>

<pre><code>my $StrainOut = ""PFP_elem"".""_$loadComb"".""_"".""$i"";
open DATAOUT, ""&gt;$StrainOut"" or die ""can't open $StrainOut"";  # Open the file for writing.

open my $in, '&lt;', ""$POSTout"" or die ""Unable to open file: $!\n"";
my $count = 0;

 while(my $line = &lt;$in&gt;) {
  last if $line =~ / ={10}\s*/;
  if ($line =~ /% *$/) {
    my @columns = split ""         "", $line;
    $count++;
    if($count % 10 == 0) {
      print DATAOUT ""$columns[1]\n"";
    }
    else {
      print DATAOUT ""$columns[1] "";
    }      
  }
}
close (DATAOUT);
close $in;
</code></pre>

<p>What needs changing is the ""my @columns = split..."" line. At the moment it splits up the $line scalar whenever it has '9 spaces'. As the number of digits of the element numbers can vary, this is a poor way of extracting the data. Is it possible to just read from left to right, omitting all spaces and recording numbers only until the numbers are followed by more spaces (that way the percentage value is ignored)?</p>

<p>You can see through my rather lengthy conversion with aaronfrost that we determined the jquery was loading in the .php (as seen on the network tab in CHROME) however it's trying to be ran as a script immediately.  My question is where or not it's possible to load that in as plain text and simply then do a js parse out the needed data.   Doesn't have to be jQuery this was just the route we were going in this example.  I've also tried with the following code and recieve the exact same ""Unexpected token"" error.  I think if there were a way to just some how handle the malformed JSON client side we would be able to make this work, in a ugly sort of way.</p>

<p>If javascript doesn't work do you think going the route of a java applet (preserve client cookies, non-server side) would achieve the desired end result i'm looking for?</p>

6036317,Convert Xcode project to New Xcode 4 with Git and enable .gitignore?,"<p>I'm sort of stumbling around with an issue with Xcode 4, and Git.  I'm a one man shop with multiple macs, and had my project working with Git and Xcode4, (stored on a dropbox folder), so I could share that folder across my MBP and iMac with minimal interaction.   So, it was late one night and I accidentally committed my xcode project file, and then I started getting issues with UserInterfaceState.xuserstate constantly updating...  Later learned that .gitignore would have been good to have in place.</p>

<p>Back to the drawing board and I've been trying to take the new (old) project and enable git on it with the following:
$cd path/to/project
$git init
$git add .
$git commit -m ""Initial commit of project""</p>

<p>This works fine, now I'm back in XCODE, and add the repository, which it recognizes in Organizer.   One Issue is XCODE doesn't recognize that I've modified a file, and the majority of the ""Source Control"" menu items are disabled, Ex: ""Commit""</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there are a recommended # of steps to:</p>

<p>1) Get Git running on a xcode project that wasn't set up this way initially
2) Steps to add the Gitignore file and when</p>

<ul>
<li>Ultimately would like the ""Source Control"" menu items enabled again.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm obviously learning some Git SCM related items with xcode 4, and I appreciate your feedback!</p>

6036319,Using ? with sed,"<p>I just want to get the number of a file that may or may not be gzip'd.  However, it appears that a regular expression in sed does not support a <code>?</code>.  Here's what I tried:</p>

<p><code>echo 'file_1.gz'|sed -n 's/.*_\(.*\)\(\.gz\)?/\1/p'</code></p>

<p>and nothing was returned.  Then I added a <code>?</code> to the string being analyzed:</p>

<p><code>echo 'file_1.gz?'|sed -n 's/.*_\(.*\)\(\.gz\)?/\1/p'</code></p>

<p>and got:</p>

<p><code>1</code></p>

<p>So, it looks like the <code>?</code> used in most regex's is not supported in sed, right?  Well then, I would just like sed to give a <code>1</code> for <code>file_1</code> and <code>file_1.gz</code>.  What's the best way to do that in a bash script if execution time is critical?</p>

6036346,Web frameworks with scaffolding and/or web based DB administration tools?,"<p>I'm looking for web app frameworks and/or database administration tools, either popular and unpopular, written in any language, for any relational database.</p>

<p>In short, I'm looking for <strong>web accessible CRUD front-ends with minimal programming effort</strong>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">phpMyAdmin</a> (<a href=""http://www.mysql.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">MySQL</a> administration tool)</li>

6036347,Strategy for garbage collecting Java objects created by custom OpenOffice spreadsheet functions,"<p>I have written an OpenOffice / LibreOffice add-in that implements some custom Calc spreadsheet functions in Java. Some of these functions create Java objects that are then logically associated with the result of the function and thus also associated with the cell that the function is used in.</p>

<p>(Assuming for now that the function is being called from a cell formula and not from the Function Wizard or some other context).</p>

<p>OpenOffice does not tell custom functions which cell they are being called from, so it is not easy to figure out that association. If the parameters to the function are cell addresses then it is possible to look at those cells and find the cells that are dependent on them - this narrows down the possibilities.</p>

<p>It could be possible to include a unique key for the Java object in the result if it is a string, but that is ugly. I could then periodically scan all cells to make sure that the unique key is still present in one or more cells.</p>

<p>However, the function could also be nested within other functions in a formula, so there is no guarantee that the key will end up being visible in the resulting value of the cell.</p>

<p>I am looking for a clean way to detect that the logical reference to the object has gone away (because the instance of the function was called with different args, or the formula containing the function has been deleted or altered).</p>

<p>Edit:
Returning an XVolatileResult looked promising, however the removeResultListener() call-back is never called when a formula is deleted (except at document close). </p>

<p>Some more clarification:
A custom function is implemented as an instance method of an Uno component (there may be more than one custom function on a single component). Only one instance of the component is ever created.</p>

<p>The function method is called with string or numeric arguments, corresponding to the arguments in the spreadsheet formula. It is also possible to receive the args as cell references rather than values.</p>

<p>The result of the function is a string or numeric value or an XVolatileResult. It is not possible to return an arbitrary Java object.</p>

<p>I am creating Java objects as a side-effect of evaluating the function and I want to be able to reference those objects in other formulas in other cells.</p>

6036348,How to prepend a path to a buildout-generated script,"<p>Scripts generated by <code>zc.buildout</code> using <code>zc.recipe.egg</code>, on our <code>&lt;package&gt;/bin/</code> directory look like this:</p>

<pre><code>#! &lt;python shebang&gt; -S

import sys
sys.path[0:0] = [
    ... # some paths derived from the eggs
    ... # some other paths included with zc.recipe.egg `extra-path`
]

# some user initialization code from zc.recipe.egg `initialization`

# import function, call function
</code></pre>

<p>What I have not been able to was to find a way to <em>programmatically</em> <strong>prepend</strong> a path at the <code>sys.path</code> construction introduced in every script. Is this possible?</p>

<p>Why: I have a version of my python project installed globally and another version of it installed locally (off-buildout tree). I want to be able to switch between these two versions.</p>

<p>Note: Clearly, one can use the <code>zc.recipe.egg</code>/<code>initialization</code> property to add something like:</p>

<pre><code>initialization = sys.path[0:0] = [ /add/path/to/my/eggs ]

<p>But, is there any other way? Extra points for an example! </p>

6036350,Bad kerning when using -[NSString drawInRect: withAttributes:],"<p>When using -[NSString drawInRect:withAttributes:], mainly when using the built-in Helvetica Neue but also with other fonts, the kerning is really bad. However, when the same string is rendered in Text Edit (which uses NSTextView) the kerning is great. Consider these two strings:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/VbbVU.png"" alt=""Bad kerning""></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/EJ0Dl.png"" alt=""Good kerning""></p>

<p>For small point sizes, the first case (rendered in Cocoa) is nearly illegible, while the second case (from Text Edit) is much better. I don't think that kerning information is being used at all here. If I apply the NSKernAttribute with a value of 0.0 (which according to the documentation turns off kerning) I get the same result, the one at the top.</p>

<p>I also tried using Core Text with CTLineDraw, but still got the bad kerning. So my question is, is there anything special I need to do to enable kerning in the Cocoa text system? If not, how does NSTextView apply kerning?</p>

6036352,Views with business logic vs code,"<p>For an application I need to send personalized invitation emails to end-users every hour. Those users email-addresses, and the rest of their information are in the database.  </p>

<ul>
<li>All users that have a bit

have a <code>Planned.DateStart</code> and a
<code>Planned.DateEnd</code> between a certain
period are available for receiving an
email message. </li>
<li>There are about <strong>350 messages</strong> to sent <strong>every hour</strong>.</li>
<li>All information that
must be included in the message is
from the Database. </li>
<li>The application is
a <strong>.NET4.0 Console application</strong>, for data
access I use <strong>Subsonic3.0</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are at least <strong>two scenarios</strong> to choose from: retrieving the appropriate data via a </p>

<p>1:) View something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT    [Computer].ComputerName, 
          [User].UserEmail, 
          [Planned].DateAvailable,

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vv7SX.jpg"" alt=""graph of the structure""></p>

<p>2:) <strong>Compose the entire message on the sql-server</strong> in the view and return something like</p>

<pre><code>[EmailTo]
[Subject]
[Body]
</code></pre>

<p>Then only iterate trough the results and create <code>MailMessage</code> Objects from it</p>

<p>in both cases I get the messages like:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (vwGetInvitableComputer u in UserController.GetAllInvitableUsers())
{
    // where the usercontroller wraps the Subsonic logic.
    // the composition happens here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Iterate trough that in the C# code and just compose the mailmessage from that preformatted data.</p>

<p>What scenario is performance and resources wise to choose?</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong> There is indeed text manipulation in the database in option 2. However, this is replacing three strings in the messagbody to the CompterName, DateStart and DateEnd.Perhaps, SQL-views are smart enough to spread the performance  for this, while the c# code does it ""when requested""?</p>

<p>I've figured out everything except how get the <code>GridView</code>'s PageCount property to work with our web services. Currently, our web services return the total record count like the following:</p>

<pre><code>public object[] GetStuffMethod(int pageNum, int recordsPerPage, out int totalRecords)
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine with a GridView, however the documentation I've found says that the <code>GrideView</code>'s <code>PageCount</code> property is generated from the total records in the DataSource. Is there really no way to set the PageCount based on something else other than returning all of the records?</p>

<p>There could be tens of thousands of records in my data source so I'd rather not select all of them just to make the GridView's page count work. I probably could just ignore the GridView's page count and calculate it on my own, but if the framework has a way to do this, I'd rather use it.</p>

3.0Gb/s</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using Vista 64 Ultimate.  </p>

<p>The issue: The 2x500 GB serve as the D drive which I use as a file server.  Mainly, it's a development machine, but does some light file serving on the LAN.  When copying files (particularly large files) to the Raid Array (D Drive, the computer tends to freeze up). I'm forced into a hard reboot.</p>

<p>Things I've investigated and tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ran Vista included memory tester</li>
<li>Event Log shows nothing relevant, or
close to the time frame of the lock
up</li>
<li>Currently running GRC's SpinRite on
drives while not in Raid mode.</li>
<li>Up to date with all Microsoft Updates</li>
<li>Raid Drivers are listed as up to
date, and device manager does not
find any newer when searching the internet</li>
<li>I have had an occasional freeze while
playing games (TeamFortress 2, for
example), but that has been more
rare.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other changes (not attempts to fix)
-changed a few days ago to AMD Phenom X4 3000Ghz</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>I understand there to be Vista File
copying issues, and was considering
a move to Win 7.   Can anyone
confirm or discount the chances that
would improve the situation.</li>
<li>I have not found any known issues
with SB700 chipset (780g) and my
setup, does anyone know of any?</li>
<li>I believe my power supply is
sufficient for the devices I have. 
However, Is it possible that this
could be a symptom of insufficient
power?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any thought or insight are appreciated.  Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: The computer has passed a spin-rite run and memtest86.  </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: I'm replacing the power supply and going to try out the HD tester.  If neither of those produce anything, I may move to non-raid and do scripted xcopy in order to keep the 3rd drive as a backup.</p>

<p>RESOLUTION: The power supply did not do it.  However, while replacing, I noticed that the 3 hard drives were all in the same SATA grouping, while the dvd drive was on it's own.  This got me thinking that the raid controller knew nothing about the dvd rom drive, and I was always uncomfortable with the main drive being listed in the raid setup but not in a raid mode.  </p>

<p>I moved it to the other grouping, and noticed that the bios listed it as it's true self (a maxtor sata drive) and the raid card no longer listed it.  Now copies of large files look great.  </p>

<p>It's unclear if that was an issue with the raid setup, or the fact that such a copy would put heavy load on 3 HDDs on the same sata controller.  But either way, I'm fixed and can recommend a better setup for users of that raid southbridge controller.</p>

<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0262012111"" rel=""nofollow"">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> and got stuck on VC dimension. Here's a quote from the book:</p>

<p><em>""...we see that an axis-aligned rectangle can shatter four points in two dimensions. Then VC(H), when H is the hypothesis class of axis-aligned rectangles in two dimensions, is four. In calculating the VC dimension, it is enough that we find four points that can be shattered; it is not necessary that we be able to shatter any four points...""</em></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/10KWV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And I don't understand that. If it's enough to find <em>some</em> separable combinations, why can't we just choose a ""rectangle with positive examples"" from the image above, put another $n$ positive ones therein, and then say $VC(H)$ increased by $n$? And if all cases must be separable then why we don't consider 4 points placed on a line - which is in general not possible to shatter by a rectangle?</p>

<p>The same with the linear classifier example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC_dimension#Shattering"" rel=""nofollow"">on wikipedia VC article</a> - on their image four points are impossible to shatter, but we can come up with a layout where it <em>is</em> possible. And conversely, we can put 3 points (as ""+"", ""-"", ""+"") on a line and it won't be possible to separate the positives from the negatives by a linear classifier.</p>

But I fail to see how this leads to a retain cycle because the block itself is a <code>__weak</code>reference, so it should be fine. If I understood ARC weak references correctly, when the <code>-foobar</code> method returns the block passed to <code>self.testBlock</code> should be deallocated (if not held elsewhere) and thus also release <code>self</code>.</p>

  you still have to check for collision with

  every other sprite, then return a

6036373,implement binary search with string prefix?,"<p>How can I implement binary search to find a string with a particular prefix in generic array (which in this case will be a string[]). I tried compareTo but that wouldn't help because i have to use a string prefix. eg String prefix ""Bi"" bill, bilards ...etc..</p>

<p>Implement the following method to return all strings in an alphabetically sorted array that start with a given preﬁx. For instance, given a preﬁx “bi”, the returned strings are ”Bill Clinton”, ”Bill Gates”, and ”Bill Joy”. Note that all string comparisons should be case INSENSITIVE. The strings in the returned list must be in the order in which they appear in the array. Your implementation must be based on binary search, and must run in worst case O(log n+k) time, where n is the length of the array, and k is the number of matching strings. Assume that the array has no duplicate entries. If there are no matches, you may either return null, or an empty array list.</p>

<p>You may use the following String methods (in addition to any others you may recall):
boolean startsWith(String s)
int compareTo(String s)
int compareToIgnoreCase(String s)
String toLowerCase(String s)
String toUpperCase(String s)
(As for ArrayList, you only need to use the add method to add an item to the end of the array list.)
You may write helper methods (with full implementation) as necessary. You may not call any method that you have not implemented yourself</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; ArrayList prefixMatch(T[] list, String prefix) {

        ArrayList&lt;T&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();

            int mid = (hi + lo) / 2;

            list[mid].startsWith(prefix) ? 0 : list[mid].compareTo((T) prefix));

<ol>
<li>Create a large test file, save it to another storage device (<em>not</em> the Momentus XT), and compute the SHA-1 checksum.</li>
<li>Write the test file to the Momentus XT.</li>
<li>Read the test file from the Momentus XT, calculate the SHA-1, and compare this checksum with the checksum of the original. We should have a match. We have probably reproduced the problem if they don't match. (Only 'probably', because it is possible for other issues to cause a mismatch.

Here are some notes from my testing (I have been able to reproduce this problem on three consecutive Momentus XT drives; I RMA'd twice and am now on the third one):</p>

<ul>
<li>What seems to be happening is that the Momentus XT sometimes neglects to write data to the drive, so that when I read from the drive, I get what was originally on the sector, and not the correct data. This occurs in blocks of different sizes; typical sizes are 1 MiB and 512 KiB.</li>
<li>Problem occurs on ext2, ext4, Btrfs, NTFS, and FAT32. Strangely, I was not able to reproduce this problem on ext3.</li>
<li>Writing with the <code>oflag=direct</code> output flag in <code>dd</code> avoids this problem. Rapidly commiting data to disk with <code>while true; do sync; sleep 0.01; done</code> also prevents the problem.</li>
<li>I have only been able to reproduce this problem through a SATA and an eSATA interface. A USB connection seems to prevent the problem. (Not sure if this is due to transfer speed.)</li>
<li>Problems occur more often with large files (>2 GB). I was not able to produce problems with files smaller than about 85 MB.</li>
<li>I was not able to reproduce the problem on Windows XP with NTFS.</li>
<li>Gazoi at the Seagate forums was <a href=""http://forums.seagate.com/t5/Momentus-XT-Momentus-Momentus/Momentus-XT-corrupting-large-files-Linux/m-p/111142#M3389"" rel=""nofollow"">unable to reproduce the problem</a> on FreeBSD 8.2 with UFS2.</li>
<li>The Momentus XT passes both the extended SMART test and <code>badblocks -w</code> with no issues.</li>
<li>My laptop (MS-1656-ID1) has successfully passed through 24 hours each of Memtest86+, Memtest86, memtester, and MPrime.</li>
<li>I have tested two other storage devices (a Seagate Momentus 7200.4 and an Intel 320 series SSD) with the same procedure, and they both pass with no issues.</li>

6036396,How does Facebook auto display the image in the right size depending on user screens?,"<p>I noticed that when displaying photos from Albums, Facebook on web will cleverly detect your screensize and selects the right thumbnail photo and then selects the right width and height for the img element.</p>

<p>I used the chrome developer tools to look at the natural and displayed width and height of the images in Facebook.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a photo viewed on a 20.41"" x 12.8"" monitor at 1600x1200 resolution</p>

<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/3T2z0K2p0z2X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/3T2z0K2p0z2X</a></p>

<p>Notice how it mentions that the image src is _o.jpg suffix and the natural dimensions are 1529x2048 whereas the current image element dimensions are 432 x 578 </p>

<p>Here is the same image on a 14 inch macbook air displaying at 1440 x 900 resolution.</p>

<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/3V113r310r0m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/3V113r310r0m</a></p>

<p>This one uses the suffix _n which you cannot see clearly, but you can see that the natural dimentions are 717 x 960 whereas the current image element dimensions are 538 x 720</p>

<p>My reason to find out is to learn the same strategy but to use it for displaying artwork which is in the standard png or jpeg format.</p>

<p>How much of the strategy is implemented using css? How much in javascript?</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>how does Facebook do this detection?</li>
<li>How many thumbnails does facebook create for each original photo?</li>
<li>How does Facebook determine the right width and height for the img element depending on screen size?</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe Facebook allows a max of <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Photos/Does-Facebook-throw-away-full-size-original-photos"" rel=""nofollow"">2048by2048 resolution.</a></p>

<p>Other than that, I am unable to find out more.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> How can I create a Coda Slider style navigation that uses horizontal sliding/scrolling <em>but</em> adaptes its height during the sliding animation to the height needed for the content?</p>

<p>For instance, the first 'slide' only has a picture in it (400px width, 300px height) but the next slide has lots of info including pictures, text and video content totalling at 400px width and 800px in height.
Now, creating a 800px high container to begin with is just a waste of space for slide 1 so i need to dynamically based upon the height needed by the content of the individual slide change the height of the slide's container.</p>

<p>Is this possible?
Maybe there is a tutorial somewhere out there and one of yous could point me towards that.</p>

<p>In terms of technology I am quite adapt at xHTML and CSS but only an amateur at jQuery and PHP.
While this should not be a restriction to your answer, please keep it in mind when explaining things.</p>

I look forward to your ideas, solution and general input.</p>

6036411,Efficiently Scroll and Zoom Photos Using UIScrollView and UIImageView,"<p>I need a simple way of scrolling through photos and zooming each photo as needed. Just like original Apple's Photo app. I understand the concept: UIScrollView has many UIScrollView  subviews as pages and each of those has a UIImageView to zoom in.</p>

<p>However, I've also seen an example, which I can no longer find, with more efficient way of doing this - using only 3 pages (UIScrollView's) for as many photos as there are to save memory usage. So basically, if there are 10 photos, only 3 pages shown (centered visible, left hidden, right hidden) and as you scroll left or right new images are being placed into those pages to simulate an effect of continuous scroll. </p>

<p>My question is how is this done or is there an existing example so I do not reinvent the wheel?</p>

6036415,Consolidation of mysql queries to an associative array breaks code - complete,"<p>In my database class I keep an associative array of mysql calls that looks like this (abrvievated for example).</p>

<p>I'm not sure on the correctness of this.<br>
PHP requires me to escape the inner apostrophes or I get an error. It tried using double quotes for the outside and single quotes on the inside but this produced an error as well.</p>

<p>When I want to run a query I do something like this.  </p>

<pre><code>$query=$this-&gt;qlist['signin_pass'];
$row=mysqli_fetch_row(database::query($query));
</code></pre>

<p>However, since I have moved the query into the associatve array...the code no longer works.  My validation fails.  PHP does not throw an error so I'm having a hard time troubleshooting it.</p>

<p>When I replace the associatve array element with the actual element like this.  It works.</p>

<pre><code>   $query=""SELECT pass FROM cr WHERE email='$email'"";
   $row=mysqli_fetch_row(database::query($query));

6036416,Targeting .NET3.5 with ASP.NET MVC2 Web Application in Visual Studio 2010?,"<p>Our current environment is .NET 3.5 SP1 but we're in the process of migrating to .NET4 and Visual Studio 2010.</p>

<p>I would like to stick to using .NET 3.5 for the deployment/production environment however use Visual Studio and TFS 2010 for development, until the production environment is cleared for upgrade to .NET4. Is this possible (I assume yes :B), and how?</p>

<p>What I have tried is changing the TargetFrameworkVersion in the project settings to ""v3.5"". However, I get a build failure due to the classes in System.Web.Security that moved to System.Web.ApplicationServices in .NET 4 (e.g. MembershipUser) not being found... so it appears that it is using .NET4 libraries and not .NET3.5? Do I add the System.Web.ApplicationServices library to my project, and if so, does this mean it will still run on .NET 3.5?</p>

<p>Also, I noticed that the ToolsVersion of the project is 4.0, would changing it from 4.0 to 3.5 be the correct thing to do? When I do this, re-opening the project causes Visual Studio to run the conversion process, changing the ToolsVersion back to 4.0 ...</p>

<p>With strtotime, I wanted to subtract however hours I want to show also the results from before current time.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Without strtotime -> Results on and after 18:00<br/> 
With strtotime('-1 hour') -> Results on and after 17:00</p>

<p>That's fine, and that's how strtotime should work. However, I have custom statuses as you can see in the pastebin, <code>if($minutes2['0'] &lt;= date('G'))</code> and so on. Basically, it picks up the wrong condition for the departures before current time, and displays either ""Final Call"" or ""Scheduled Departure"" instead of ""Landed"".</p>

<p>To clarify, it should be ""Landed"" because we're in the past. The time is for example 18:00, while in reality on the schedule which departed at 17:10, the Status column shows ""On Time"" or ""On Approach"". </p>

6036436,"Simple Ajax in asp.net MVC 3, update the model and rerender part","<p>I come from a more <code>WPF</code> application background and I'm used to bindings and such. Jumping into websites then can come with it's problems as they work so much more differently.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do a simple <code>Ajax</code> action but not sure where to begin. Basically I want to make a dropdownlist that changes one property on the model and re-renders that part of the page. Perhaps this is too much of a WPF way to do this so my Model could be twisted for the thing it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>Here is what I got already:</p>

<pre><code>public class TheViewModel
{
    private IEnumerable&lt;TheData&gt; _data;

    public TheViewModel(IEnumerable&lt;TheData&gt; data)
    {
        _data = data;
        Year = 2012;
    }

    public int Year { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;TheData&gt; Data
    {
        get
        {
            return _data.Where(d =&gt; d.Year == this.Year).ToList();
        }
    }

     public IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt; YearList
     {
        // lists the available years
     }
}

public class TheData
{
    public int Year { get; set; }
    //Some more info I want to represent in Table
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the razor:</p>

<pre><code>@using (Ajax.BeginForm(new AjaxOptions { UpdateTargetId = ""thetable"" }))
{
        @Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.Year, Model.YearList, new { AutoPostBack = ""true""})
        &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""name"" value=""Submit"" /&gt;
}


&lt;table id=""thetable""&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        //some headers
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
    @foreach ( var item in Model.Data)
    {
        //row for each data
    }
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I'm hoping for the Year property to be updated and a new call to be made for the Data property which would result in new information. That information would be rendered in <code>thetable</code> Table</p>

6036437,Select element as part of the text flow,"<p>I've got a little problem with displaying a select element on my web page. I'm trying to show a select element as part of the text flow, so that a user doesn't notice it's actually a select element (apart from the border underneath). It should act just like a regular word. Currently I have this HTML code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""get"" action=""population.php""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just show me information about only: &lt;select name=""f""&gt;&lt;option&gt;a&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option&gt;b&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And with that this CSS code:</p>

<pre><code>form {
    margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    display: inline;
}
form select {
    margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
    width: auto;

    font-family: inherit;
    font-size: inherit;
    display: inline;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code doesn't work. It should be like the first picture I put below. However, in Safari the select item is forced into the first item on the row, so that the select element is before ""only: "" (second picture below). In Firefox on the other hand, the select element is put onto a new row altogether.</p>

But if there is no list on the bundle it throws up a modal view controller. That then requires someone to login, the login is authenticated and then data is downloaded. </p>

<p>The ModalView is setup to be a delegate of the first page. I can call the delegate method just fine and pass the list, but when the ModalView is dismissed the table does not reload the tableview with the data. If i run the project again it loads the list up in the table view instantly.</p>

<pre><code>[self checkLastLoginDate];
[self loadDataIntoArray];

<p>if it is then I create an IndexedArray and it displays nicely.</p>

<p>If the data is not on the bundle or the date is to old I check the device and use a modal view. The delegates are set and the ModalView Appears.</p>

<p>In the ModalView I use a syncronus and asyncronus request to hit a server for the required information. Then I create the list and pass it back to the first page.</p>

<p>Once the connection is made and we do a little work on the list we save it to the bundle.</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];
NSString *path = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:kEMPLOYEE_PLIST];

{   
    [delegate passUserInfo:employeeList];

    //cant get login view to dismiss
    //[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];
}

<p>Once I get the list I right it to file and then read it back in. If there is info in the list I call the delegate method. </p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>Here is the delgate method</p>

<p>Once that is called nothing happens. I tried dismissing the modal view, which works, but then the first page does not refresh and my app gets lost in the oblivion. I am just confused at were it is going and how i can refresh the tableview on the first page.</p>

<pre><code>@Column(name=""CREATION_DATETIME"")
@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
private Date creationDateTime
</code></pre>

<p>When I print the date value, it is in local time zone, which is acceptable because the toString() in Date uses the default time zone ; which will be the time zone where the program is running. when stored in database it is storing the local time zone value; but I want it to be stored the original value without any timezone conversion. Hibernate handles the persistence here.  why is this happening and how could it be resolved.? </p>

<p>After a random time (10 minutes / 1 hour / 1 day) my program crashs and I aren't able to start it again. The error is always about one or more files corruption. The files corrupted are random, sometimes my libs, sometimes my executable file, sometimes kernel lib, sometimes system files, apache server, ssh server etc...</p>

<p>I thought that it was an hard-disk problem, i tried to replace it but the problem occurs again.

"
6036459,Rails and queries with complex joins: Can each joined table have an alias?,"<p>I'm developing an online application for education research, where I frequently have the need for <em>very</em> complex SQL queries: </p>

<ul>
<li>queries usually include 5-20 joins, often joined to the same table several times</li>
<li>the SELECT field often ends up being 30-40 lines tall, between derived fields / calculations and CASE statements</li>
<li>extra WHERE conditions are added in the PHP, based on user's permissions &amp; other security settings</li>
<li>the user interface has search &amp; sort controls to add custom clauses to the WHERE / ORDER / HAVING clauses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently this app is built on PHP + MYSQL + Jquery for the moving parts. (This grew out of old Dreamweaver code.) Soon we are going to rebuild the application from scratch, with the intent to consolidate, clean, and be ready for future expansion. While I'm comfortable in PHP, I'm learning bits about Rails and realizing, Maybe it would be better to build version 2.0 on a more modern framework instead. But before I can commit to hours of tutorials, I need to know if the Rails querying system (ActiveRecord?) will meet our query needs.</p>

<p>Here's an example of one query challenge I'm concerned about. A query must select from 3+ ""instances"" of a table, and get comparable information from each instance:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p1.name AS my_name, pm.name AS mother_name, pf.name AS father_name
FROM people p1
    JOIN mother pm ON p1.mother_id = pm.id
    JOIN father pf ON p1.father_id = pf.id
    # etc. etc. etc.
WHERE p1.age BETWEEN 10 AND 16
# (selects this info for 10-200 people)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, a similar example, more representative of our challenges. A ""raw data"" table joins multiple times to a ""coding choices"" table, each instance of which in turn has to look up the text associated with a key it stores:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT d.*, c1.coder_name AS name_c1, c2.coder_name AS name_c2, c3.coder_name AS name_c3, 
    (c1.result + c2.result + c3.result) AS result_combined,
    m_c1.selection AS selected_c1, m_c2.selection AS selected_c2. m_c3.selection AS selected_c3
FROM t_data d
    LEFT JOIN t_codes c1 ON d.id = c1.data_id AND c1.category = 1
        LEFT JOIN t_menu_choice m_c1 ON c1.menu_choice = m_c1.id
    LEFT JOIN t_codes c2 ON d.id = c2.data_id AND c2.category = 2
        LEFT JOIN t_menu_choice m_c2 ON c2.menu_choice = m_c2.id
    LEFT JOIN t_codes c3 ON d.id = c3.data_id AND c3.category = 3
        LEFT JOIN t_menu_choice m_c3 ON c3.menu_choice = m_c3.id 
WHERE d.date_completed BETWEEN ? AND ?
    AND c1.coder_id = ?
</code></pre>

<p>These sorts of joins are straightforward to write in pure SQL, and when search filters and other varying elements are needed, a couple PHP loops can help to cobble strings together into a complete query. But I haven't seen any Rails / ActiveRecord examples that address this sort of structure. If I'll need to run every query as pure SQL using find_by_sql(""""), then maybe using Rails won't be much of an improvement over sticking with the PHP I know.</p>

<p>My question is: Does ActiveRecord support cases where tables need ""nicknames"", such as in the queries above? Can the primary table have an alias too? (in my examples, ""p1"" or ""d"") How much control do I have over what fields are selected in the SELECT statement? Can I create aliases for selected fields? Can I do calculations &amp; select derived fields in the SELECT clause? How about CASE statements? </p>

<p>How about setting WHERE conditions that specify the joined table's alias? Can my WHERE clause include things like (using the top example) "" WHERE pm.age BETWEEN p1.age AND 65 ""?</p>

<p>This sort of complexity isn't just an occasional bizarre query, it's a constant and central feature of the application (as it's currently structured). My concern is not just whether writing these queries is ""possible"" within Rails &amp; ActiveRecord; it's whether this sort of need is supported by ""the Rails way"", because I'll need to be writing a lot of these. So I'm trying to decide whether switching to Rails will cause more trouble than it's worth.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance! - if you have similar experiences with big scary queries in Rails, I'd love to hear your story &amp; how it worked out.</p>

Any idea whether this is a clue that grails 2 is just not going to work on Amazon EC2, or is likely to be worth trying on a bigger instance?

6036487,Secondary backup server,"<p>I've been given a task to implement a backup solution in the event of our website goes down. It is a dedicated server running centos 6.</p>

<p>From what i've experience on our server, our server may go down because of PHP application crash or hardware failure.</p>

<p>I have couple of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the first case, is it possible to get the server restart the PHP automatically, how can I do that? Because in my mind, if it is only the application that goes down, probably I can still make use of the server itself.</li>
<li>In the second case, can I redirect a request to a secondary server? How can I do that? What do I need other than another server?</li>
</ol>

<p>For now it is gonna be a simple server which shows the user a static landing page so later the system notify us via email that the primary server went down so that we can restart the server manually.</p>

<p>Is it possible to setup just a vps or even a shared server for the secondary server ? As I think there is only gonna be a static page.</p>

<p>Thanks. Any help would be much appreciated</p>

<pre><code>message = Mail.new(email_string)
body = message.body.decoded

<p>That gets me a string that starts like this:</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? I'm pretty sure it has to do with the ""charset=ISO-8859-1"" setting in the email, but I'm not sure how to use that, or if there's a way to easily extract that using the mail gem.</p>

6036524,"As a C# developer, would you learn Java to develop for Android or use MonoDroid instead?","<p>I'd consider myself pretty well versed in C#. It's my language of choice at the moment, and it's where basically <em>all</em> my professional experience lies.</p>

<p>Still, I'm puzzled by the existence of the <a href=""http://monodroid.net/"">MonoDroid</a> project. My understanding has always been that C# and Java are <em>very</em> close. Like, if you know one, you can learn the other really quickly. So, as I've considered developing my first Android app, I just assumed I would familiarize myself with Java enough to get started and then just sort of learn as I go.</p>

<p>Wouldn't this make more sense than using MonoDroid, which is likely to be less feature-rich than the Java Android SDK, and requires learning its own API (albeit a .NET API) anyway? I just feel like it would be better to learn a new language (and an extremely popular one at that) and get some experience in it—when it's so close to what you already know anyway—rather than stick with a technology you're experienced with, without gaining any more valuable skills.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm grossly misrepresenting the average potential MonoDroid user. Maybe it's more for people who are experienced in Java and .NET and just prefer .NET. Or maybe (in fact it's likely) there are other factors I just haven't considered. I'm just wondering, why would you use MonoDroid instead of just developing for Android using Java?</p>

6036527,"Accessing control between DataGridCells, dynamic cascading ComboBoxes","<p>I have a DataGrid that two of its columns are ComboBoxes (one contains few but not this is the problem).</p>

<p>I want, that when the user changes the first Combo's value, the ComboBox in the other column should bind to a property of its (this property is a collection). Say the First ComboBox is Category, I want that when the user changes its value, the other CB is populated with the values of (first combo's selected category).Vendors.</p>

<p>How should I do it, I don't use MVVM, just simple WPF.
I don't know what should be the right way to implement it, I hope I started it right.</p>

<p>I think, if I could get the other ComboBox (which is located in a different DataGridCell) from the first's SelectionChangeHandler that would be the best, because then I can reset its source on each selection change of the first one.
Note that I have the capability of reaching the current (the first's) DataGridCell, I am just looking for an efficient way to access the right DataGridCell sibling and then get its child (second) combo.</p>

<p>Also note that the selected category should vary from row to row, and the second ComboBox should depend on this row's category.<br>
I actually tried to implement it so that the CollectionViewSource.Source is bound to the current item (i.e. the row's DataContext) but it doesn't seem to work.<br>
I prefer to set the second combo's CollectionViewSource (VendorsCollection) thru an Action trigger or handler at the 1st ComboBox's SelectionChange.</p>

<p>The other ComboBoxes in that field don't seem to make a problem as they're all bound to each other, I might use CollectionViewSource.Filter, anyway it's not a problem to access them as they are simple siblings, not like the first one which is a distant cousin located deep in another DataGridCell.</p>

6036528,How do I know if I managed to completely remove an undetected trojan?,"<p>I catched a trojan that uses explorer.exe to reproduce itself in case of deletion of its autostart entry or main exe file in <code>Programs/x</code>.</p>

<p>It had already tried to contact a suspicious server over explorer.exe, blocked that via my firewall.</p>

<p>I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed the autostart entries from the registry</li>
<li>Looked through my services if there was anything suspicious</li>
<li>Deleted the trojan from <code>Programs/</code></li>
<li>Went through System Volume Information to find a 2 month old explorer.exe and replaced the possibly infected one.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no suspicious processes running now anymore (no duplicate explorer.exe) and nothing wants to connect this trojan owners sever either.</p>

<p>I checked my system with several anti-malware programs too.</p>

<p>What the trojan did:</p>

<ul>
<li>Started a second explorer.exe</li>
<li>Always when I deleted the main trojan exe file it was reproduced (by the second explorer.exe)</li>
<li>Always when I deleted the autostart entry it was reproduced by the explorer.exe too.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I terminated the suspicious explorer.exe, which used only half as much memory as the less suspicious one from Windows, a strange thing that I know from the computers in my Informatics class happened:</p>

<p>A window popped up in the top left of my explorer-less desktop, titled ""Personal settings for ... are ..."" that obviously copied some files.
Then both explorer.exes started again and the trojan was everywhere again.</p>

<ul>
<li>What did the trojan actually do to get explorer to rescue it?</li>
<li>Is my PC clean of this newish trojan now?</li>
<li>What are the other locations I should check for the trojan?</li>
<li>The trjoan doesn't seem very high-level, could it have changed other system files or is the autostart entry vital for it?</li>
</ul>

<p>The django docs - <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#managed"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#managed</a> documents the following:</p>

  <p>For tests involving models with managed=False, it's up to you to
  ensure the correct tables are created as part of the test setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I actually ""create"" the tables during the test setup? Or alternatively, how can I make it so that when I am running tests, this model has ""managed = True"" for the duration of the test?</p>

<p>In the real application, this model is actually backed by a view in the database. However for the during of the test, I would like to treat this as a table and be able to insert test data in there.</p>

String[] searchWords = searchStr.split("" "");

<p>As you can see, on this download page, I have placed images of the 6 editions of my e-magazine and have connected download buttons for each edition, so that whenever an user clicks on the download button, that particular file (.RAR file) will start downloading. 
Like I said, I have designed these buttons in plain HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>What I desire to have is DOWNLOAD COUNTERS for each magazine edition attached to the particualr DOWNLOAD BUTTONS -- meaning like you can see on my HTML page, the number of downloads to be written below each edition.

But if I made changes to one of them I had to do the same to the other one, and I did not want to do this. So I decided to run both companies through the same database.</p>

<p>I have one table named <code>Customer</code> and it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/m0Gkp.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><code>ID</code> is the PK and also set to auto increment. This was working all good, until I decided two run two companies in the same DB. After I decided this, I added a column named <code>CompanyID</code> to attach that customer to a spcific company. This is also working like it should, when I log into my system as a user of company 1 I get compny 1's customers and so on.</p>

<p>But the problems appear when I add a new customer to the database. I want the customer ID's to start at 1 in both companies. But as it is now, when I create a customer in copmany 1 it gets customer number 1, and when I create a new customer in company 2 it increments on the same number, so it gets customer number 2. Here I wanted it to be customer number 1. The two increments should be separated based on the <code>CompanyID</code>.</p>

<p>First step might be to add both <code>ID</code> and <code>CompanyID</code> as PK, but what else should I do to accomplish this?</p>

<p>Also, if you got another opinion on how i should solve this, I would like to know!</p>

6036577,Lua techniques and libraries for LuaTeX,"<p>With LuaTeX, it is possible to use many libraries and functions that can simplify various aspects of Lua programming. As Lua as language is quite new for the majority of TeX users, I think it would be good if we could share experiences in searching for useful libraries and techniques, that appeared to us while learning this language. Maybe we can collect a list of them.</p>

<p>Each answer should contain a description and a small example of usage.</p>

<p>Welcomed are examples using both LuaTeX (for typesetting) or TeXLua (for shell scripting).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>String interpolation:</p>

<p>As simple templating engine one can use a technique called ""string interpolation"". Various attempts are described at <a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/StringInterpolation"" rel=""nofollow"">lua wiki</a>. A simple example is following:</p>

<pre class=""lang-lua prettyprint-override""><code>#!/usr/bin/env texlua
function interp(s, tab)
  return (s:gsub('($%b{})', function(w) return tab[w:sub(3, -2)] or w end))
end
print( interp(""${name} is ${value}"", {name = ""foo"", value = ""bar""}) )
</code></pre>

<p>Which prints on the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>foo is bar
</code></pre>

<p>We can make it more simple to use:</p>

<pre class=""lang-lua prettyprint-override""><code>getmetatable("""").__mod = interp
print( ""${name} is ${value}"" % {name = ""foo"", value = ""bar""} )
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we set the <code>mod</code> operator for string to call our interpolation function, so one can use <code>""format ${val}"" % {val=""hello""}</code>.</p>

<p><strong>FURTHER EDIT</strong>
Interestingly, I thought I'd rip back to a basic working model.  I took the code from the <a href=""http://livedemo.exadel.com/richfaces-demo/richfaces/tree.jsf?tab=model&amp;cid=3835901"" rel=""nofollow"">RichFaces Demo Page</a>.  I modified the faces-config.xml to include the <code>SimpleTreeData</code> bean.  I had trouble getting the bean code which reads the data file in (<code>simple-tree-data.properties</code>) so I used a <code>FileReader</code> instead.  This built ok, and I got a modified index.jsp jsf page to list the simple tree example as on the demo page, except clicking on a list item didn't report the selected <code>nodeTitle</code> to the specified place (same problem).  </p>

<p>I can see this either as the same problem reported above or the fact that the <code>loadTree</code> method in the <code>SimpleTreeData.java</code> bean has been changed.  In the change, I removed the following lines and changed extraneous code as appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>        FacesContext facesContext = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
    ExternalContext externalContext = facesContext.getExternalContext();
    InputStream dataStream = externalContext.getResourceAsStream(DATA_PATH);
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I used a <code>FileReader</code> but does anyone think this problem could be related to me removing these 3 lines?  As also listed above, my <code>processLogSelection</code> method doesn't use <code>getCurrentInstance</code> but I'm not sure it needs to if <code>ajaxSubmitSelection=""true""</code> is listed in the JSF.</p>

<p>One state in my WebFlow receives two events that need to trigger the same action and then transition to separate states if that action is successful.  My initial attempt repeated the code in the <code>actionState</code>.  Not good.  So, after some trial and error, I came up with the following. </p>

6036592,Update rows with variable's value and use default if variable is null,"<p>
Let's say I have a variable:</p>

<pre><code>declare @x int = /* smth here */
</code></pre>

<p>And I have a table with column (e.g. <code>ColX</code>) which is <code>not null</code> and have a <code>default</code> constraint. Now I want to update some rows in the table in a way like this:</p>

<pre><code>update MyTable
set ColX = isnull(@x, default)
where blah-blah-blah
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously it can't be executed since sql-server will show you an error, but I think this example clearly reflect what I want to do.
So the question is how it can be done?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
So I have now these ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>do it through system views - get column_default propery and use dynamic query execution</li>
<li><p>perform both cases in separate subqueries: </p>

<pre><code>if @x is null then update /* use default */ else update /* use @x */
</code></pre>

<p>This way is a straightforward and the simpliest. Maybe even the most transparent for the other guy who'll read it further. Also keep in mind it will require also to have separate inserts for both   </p>

<pre><code>@x is null /* use default */ 
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>@x is not null /* use @x */
</code></pre>

<p>cases</p></li>
<li><p>create user-defined function:</p>

<pre><code>create function GetValueForColX(@value int) returns int
as begin
    return isnull(@value, /* default value */)
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then use it in default - <code>(GetValueForColX(null))</code> and in insert/update query <code>GetValueForColX(@x)</code></p></li>

6036616,vim: Including blank lines following region in fold,"<p>I'm currently attempting to improve the folding behavior of Matlab files in Vim. I have a syntax file generated and the folding behaves as I want with one exception. Say I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>function [out1,out2] = doSomething(arg1,arg2)
    out1 = performSubRoutine(arg1);
    out2 = performSubRoutine(arg2);
end

function output = performSubRoutine(input)
    output = input;
end
</code></pre>

<p>When I perform the folding I get:</p>

<pre><code>+---  4 lines: function [out1,out2] = doSomething(arg1,arg2)

+---  3 lines: function output = performSubRoutine(input)
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, I would like to have the fold engulf any trailing whitespace.</p>

<p>My region definition from the syntax file is:</p>

<pre><code>syn region matlabClassBlock     
            \transparent fold 
            \matchgroup=matlabClass 
            \extend start='\&lt;function\&gt;'        
            \end='\%([%-+(\*\:(\/\[]\s*\)\@&lt;!\&lt;end\&gt;\%(\s*[-+}\:\*\/()\]]\)\@!.*\($\n^\s*\)*$'re=e 
            \contains=ALLBUT,@matlabClassCluster,@matlabProceduralCluster
</code></pre>

<p>I used the offset specifier ""re=e"" to say that I want to fold to the end of the match, but I still get the first result. </p>

<p>I must be missing something, because the documentation states that the offset method should work. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I have added a response to that post, but being quite old, I thought I might re-post it as a new question. If you can help me out, that would be great!</p>

<p>I have a matrix (G) that I need to separate into 3 zones on a plot, divided by two contours (cutoff1 and cutoff2).</p>

<pre><code>depth = seq(mindepth,maxdepth,part)
width = seq(minwidth,maxwidth,part)
G = matrix(0,length(width),length(depth))

# G filled in with values at each coordinate from depth/width.

filled.contour2(width,depth,G,levels=seq(0,cutoff1),col=colors()[374])
filled.contour2(width,depth,G,levels=seq(cutoff1,cutoff2),col=colors()[411])
filled.contour2(width,depth,G,levels=seq(cutoff2,max(G)),col=colors()[50])
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work because consecutive filled.contour2 operations overwrite the previous ones. I can't post images because I'm new to posting on this site, but the three separated zones are simple and the separating contours do not overlap.</p>

<p>It looks like something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>plot(width,depth,G,cont=c(cutoff1), display=""filled.contour2"", col=colors()[411])
</code></pre>

<p>should work, but obviously this isn't the right way to call plot.</p>

<p>when I use</p>

<pre><code>    myClient.getObject(myGetObjectRequest, myFile)

<p>I get an AmazonClientException saying there are too many files open.</p>

<p>Now, each time I download a file, edit it and copy it back to the bucket, I delete the temporary files I create.
I'm assuming it's taking a few milliseconds to delete the file, and maybe that's why I'm getting these errors.
Or is it maybe because of the open files on Amazon's side?</p>

<p>Anyway, I made my application sleep for 3 seconds each time it encounters this exception, that way it would have time to close the files, but that just takes too much time. Even if I'll take it down to 1 second.</p>

<p>Has anybody encountered this problem?
What should I do?</p>

<p>I prefer reading and writing the second, but I recall reading in code complete that doing things like that is bad for maintainability.  </p>

<p>This is because you are relying on the language to not evaluate the second part of the <code>if</code> if the first part is false and not all languages do that.  (The second part will throw an exception if evaluated with a null <code>byteArrayVariable</code>.)</p>

<p>To deal with that, I was advised to use the <strong><em>[ValidateInput(false)]</em></strong> attribute to release the checking, but without success. Until, by accident, I did a postback to a different action method (i.e. not the one that displayed the view containning TextArea control). so I have to explicit both the Action and the controller. IT WORKED. So I tried to <strong>explicitly</strong> declare the BeginForm for the first case, then, IT WORKED AGAIN. </p>

<p>I have this string stored in a variable:</p>

<p>Now I would like to split the strings by ';' delimiter so that I have</p>

<p>I don't necessarily need the <code>ADDR1</code> and <code>ADDR2</code> variables. If they are elements of an array that's even better.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: After suggestions from the answers below, I ended up with the following which is what I was after:</p>

arr=$(echo $IN | tr "";"" ""\n"")

<p><strong>Edit2</strong>: There was a solution involving setting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_field_separator"">Internal_field_separator</a> (IFS) to ';'. I am not sure what happened with that answer, how do you reset IFS back to default?</p>

6036653,IE9 RC1 incorrectly encoding input field names that have character entities,"<p>I think I may have found a bug with the latest IE9 release candidate, but before I log the issue on connect.microsoft.com, I wanted to validate with the brains-trust here that my understanding is correct.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>A HTML form contains an input field, whose name attribute contains character entities (&amp;quot),  eg. &lt;input type=""text"" name=""MyText[Identifier=&amp;quot;test&amp;quot;]"" value=""hello""&gt;</p>

<p>In IE8, FF, Safari &amp; Chrome, when the form is submitted, any non-safe ASCII chars are encoded in the HTTP request.  So the above input field would be sent in the POST as</p>

<p>MyText%5BIdentifier%3D%22test%22%5D=hello</p>

<p>Here, we can see that the square brackets are encoded as %5B and %5D, the equals symbol is encoded as %3D, and the &amp;quot entities encoded as %22.</p>

<p>In IE9 RC1, this input field is being sent in the POST as</p>

<p>MyText%5BIdentifier%3D% <strong>25</strong> 22test% <strong>25</strong> 22%5D=hello</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What <em>seems</em> to have happened here is,
  after the non-safe ASCII chars are
  encoded, IE9 is then <em>further
  encoding</em> the percent symbols of the
  %22 as %25 (giving %2522).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think it should be doing this (and as I mentioned above, no other browsers, including previous IE versions, did this).</p>

<p>According to the W3C validator, character entities such as &amp;quot in input names are valid, so it's not simply a case of IE9 being stricter than the other browsers, as I first thought.</p>

<p>Is my assumption correct, and should I proceed to log this as a bug in IE9?</p>

"
6036655,"Serial port loopback/duplex test, in Bash or C? (process substitution)","<p>I have a serial device set up as loopback (meaning it will simply echo back any character it receives), and I'd like to measure effective throughput speed. For this, I hoped I could use <code>time</code>, as in</p>

<pre><code>time bash -c '...'
</code></pre>

<p>where '<code>...</code>' would be some command I could run. </p>

<p>Now, the first problem is that I want to use the device at 2000000 bps, so I cannot use  <a href=""http://man.gnusquad.org/ttylog/section-8/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">ttylog</a> or <a href=""http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/screen/"" rel=""nofollow"">screen</a> (they both seem to go up to 115200 bps only). However, working with <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> as a file (using file redirection and <code>cat</code>) seems to work fine:</p>

<pre><code># initialize serial port
stty 2000000 -ixon icanon &lt;/dev/ttyUSB0

# check settings
stty -a -F /dev/ttyUSB0

# in one terminal - read from serial port
while (true) do cat -A /dev/ttyUSB0 ; done

# in other terminal - write to serial port
echo ""1234567890"" &gt; /dev/ttyUSB0

# back to first terminal, I now have:
# $ while (true) do cat -A /dev/ttyUSB0 ; done
# 1234567890$
# ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'd like to do something similar - I'd like to <code>cat</code> a file to a serial port, and have the serial port read back - but from a single terminal command (so I could use it as argument to <code>time</code>). </p>

<p>I thought that I could use a Bash process substitution, to have the ""writing"" and ""reading"" part go, sort of, in ""parallel"" - if I try it with named pipes, it works:</p>

<pre><code># mkfifo my.pipe # same as below:
$ mknod my.pipe p

$ comm &lt;(echo -e ""test\ntest\ntest\n"" &gt; my.pipe) &lt;(cat my.pipe)
    test
    test
    test
comm: file 2 is not in sorted order
</code></pre>

<p>Up there, I'm not using <code>comm</code> for any other purpose, than to (sort of) merge the two processes into a single command (I guess, I could have just as well used <code>echo</code> instead). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that trick does not seem to work with a serial port, because when I try it, I sometimes get:</p>

<pre><code>$ comm &lt;(echo ""1234567890"" &gt; /dev/ttyUSB0) &lt;(while (true) do cat -A /dev/ttyUSB0 ; done)
cat: /dev/ttyUSB0: Invalid argument
</code></pre>

<p>..., however, usually I just get no output whatsoever. This tells me that: either there is no control of which process starts first, and so <code>cat</code> may start reading before the port is ready (however, that doesn't seem to be a problem in the first example above); or in Linux/Bash, you cannot both read and write to a serial port at the same time, and so the ""<code>Invalid argument</code>"" would occur in those moments when both read and write seem to happen at the same time. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way to do something like this (<code>cat</code> a file to a serial port configured as loopback; read it back and see how long it takes) only in Bash, without resorting to writing a dedicated C program? </li>
<li>If I need a dedicated C program, any source examples out there on the net I could use? </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks a lot for any responses, </p>

<p>Cheers! </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: I am aware that the <code>while</code> loop written above does not exit; that command line was for preliminary testing, and I interrupt it using Ctrl-C. ( <em>I could in principle interrupt it with something like <code>timeout -9 0.1 bash -c 'while (true) do echo AA ; done'</code>, but that would defeat the purpose of <code>time</code>, then :)</em> )</p>

<p>The reason that <code>while</code> is there, is that for the time being, reading via <code>cat</code> from the device exits immediately; at times, I <em>have</em> set up the device, so that when <code>cat</code> is issued, it in fact blocks and waits for incoming data; but I cannot as of yet figure what's going on (and partially that is why I'm looking for a way to test from the command line). </p>

<p>In case I didn't use the <code>while</code>, I imagine for timing, I'd use something like:</p>

<p><code>time bash -c 'comm &lt;(echo ""1234567890"" &gt; /dev/ttyUSB0) &lt;(cat -A /dev/ttyUSB0)'</code></p>

<p>... however for this to be working, sort of, assumes that <code>cat -A /dev/ttyUSB0</code> starts first and blocks; then the <code>echo</code> writes to the serial port (and exits); and then <code>cat -A</code> outputs whatever it read from the serial port - and then exits. (<em>And I'm not really sure neither if a serial port can behave this way at all, nor if <code>cat</code> can be made to block and exit arbitrarily like that</em>). </p>

<p>The exact method really doesn't matter; if at all possible, I'd just like to avoid coding my own C program to do this kind of testing - which is why my primary interest is if it is somehow possible to run such a ""full-duplex test"" using basic Bash/Linux (i.e. <code>coreutils</code>); (<em>and if not, if there is a ready-made code I can use for something like this</em>). </p>

6036657,How can I design a curve editor that works well with the WPF model?,"<p>I have a data model that represents segments of a curve that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/9059/envelope.png"" alt=""Envelope curve""></p>

<p>The fields are x and y coordinates of the anchor points (red), and a slope value represented by the control points (green). For the curve to be editable by the user, I'm thinking of using Thumb objects for both anchor and control points.</p>

<p>Since I also would like to be able to present the user with an interface where it is possible to enter coordinates into text boxes, I'm thinking of implementing this curve editor as a lookless control. The problem I face is to find the best way to organise the elements. Some thoughts on what I could do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the data model view objects to an ItemsContainer with a custom ItemsPanel and a DataTemplate that creates one anchor point and one control point for each data model object. This causes two and two points to be wrapped in a ContentPresenter which makes the interaction between the custom panel and the thumb points difficult.</li>
<li>Use two different data model view objects, one for anchor points and one for control points, and a DataTemplateSelector to select the right DataTemplate. While there still is a ContentPresenter between the item and the panel (is it possible to avoid this?), interaction may be easier when there is only one item in the ContentPresenter.</li>
<li>Don't use ItemsContainer at all, instead add the Thumb objects directly to the visual and logical trees of the custom panel. Of course I loose a lot of flexibility when it comes to the look and feel of the Thumb objects when they are not specified by templates. Maybe it's possible to duplicate this functionality from ItemsContainer so my control can have separate DataTemplates for the anchor and control points. The Thumb objects could then be added directly to the panel without ContentPresenters.</li>
</ol>

<p>What's the most reasonable way to do this? Are there other alternatives than the ones I've thought of?</p>

6036660,2D Tile Transitions,"<p>I know this is a topic that has been covered a lot, and I'm aware of the different methods of tackling 2d tile blending. The two predominant ways appear to be alpha masking (which seems expensive) or creating graphics for each transition, as following this popular tutorial.</p>

<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/7hya4zy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/7hya4zy</a></p>

<p>I'm a newish game programmer, so this is really a question from lack of experience, but really what are your tips to go about blending terrain efficiently. My first concern is that my game uses 128x128px tiles (something I want to keep), and the tutorial suggests I'd need 32 tiles per texture to cover all transitions. The troubles is with 16 tiles in a row at 128px that's 2048 pixels wide, so double that for all 32, then start adding in all the other terrain and texture that will come, big sprite sprites, big files, going to hurt game performance etc.</p>

<p>At the moment I think my best approach would be to have the bare minimum transition tiles in the actual sprite sheet, such as only a single corner piece, which can then be rotated in game (presumably before render then cached and used every render call) and drawn. </p>

<p>Either way, I'm no expert, so any general tips from you people who understand/have done this before would be very much appreciated, it's just stuff I need to learn!</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

6036664,IE8 native JSON.parse bug causes stack overflow,"<p>TL;DR: <strong>Adding any non-built-in functions to Array.prototype AND Function.prototype will cause the IE8 native JSON parser to get a stack overflow when parsing any JSON that contains an array, but only when you also pass a reviver function into JSON.parse().</strong></p>

<p>This started out as a question, but I answered my own original question, so now I'll ask: can anyone think of a work-around for this IE8 bug that doesn't involve eliminating all JS libraries that modify Array.prototype and Function.prototype?</p>

<p><em>Original question:</em></p>

<p>I have about 13k of JSON data to parse. The structure of the data is an object with a single value that is a nested array.</p>

<pre><code>{ 'value':[[ stuff ], [ more stuff], [ etc ]] }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using json2.js, which defers to the browser native JSON.parse when available. I'm passing a reviver function into JSON.parse to handle dates properly. When IE8 is in IE7 emulation mode (which causes it to use the script-based json2.js parser) everything works fine. When IE8 is in IE8 mode (which causes it to use the browser-native JSON parser) it blows up with an ""out of stack space"" error. Firefox and Chrome, of course, work just fine with their browser-native JSON parsers.</p>

<p>I've narrowed it down to this: if I pass even a do-nothing reviver function into JSON.parse, the IE8 native parser gets the stack overflow. If I pass in no reviver function, the IE8 native parser works fine, except it doesn't parse dates correctly.</p>

<pre><code>// no error:
JSON.parse(stuff);

// ""out of stack space"" error:
JSON.parse(stuff, function(key, val) { return val; });
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to play with my JSON data, to see if less data or less nesting of the data can avoid the error, but I was wondering if anyone had seen this before, or had any other suggested work-arounds. IE8 is slow enough already, it would be a shame to disable native JSON for that browser because of this bug.</p>

<p>UPDATE: In other cases, with different JSON data, I'm getting a javascript error ""$lineinfo is undefined"" when I use the IE8 native parser with a reviver function, and no error if I use no reviver function. The string ""$lineinfo"" does not appear anywhere in any of my source code.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: Actually, this problem seems to be caused by Prototype 1.6.0.3. I was unable to reproduce it in an isolated test page until I added in the Prototype library.</p>

<p>UPDATE 3:</p>

<p>The reason prototype.js breaks the IE8 native JSON parser is this: Adding any non-built-in functions to Array.prototype AND Function.prototype will cause the IE8 native JSON parser to get a stack overflow when parsing any JSON that contains an array, but only when you also pass a reviver function into JSON.parse().</p>

<p>The Prototype library adds functions to both Array.prototype and Function.prototype, but this applies equally to any other library that does the same thing. This bug in the IE JSON parser is exposed by Prototype and Ext, but not jQuery. I haven't tested any other frameworks.</p>

<p>Here is a completely stand-alone reproduction of the problem. If you remove the Function.prototype line, or the Array.prototype line, or remove the array from the JSON string, you won't get the ""out of stack space"" error.</p>

6036671,How do I refresh updated Git dependency artifacts in SBT?,"<p>I've configured SBT (0.11.0) to pull in a GitHub project as a dependency, as per my answer on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7550376/how-can-sbt-pull-dependency-artifacts-from-git/8828803#8828803"">this question here</a>.</p>

<p>It works fine except that I can't seem to get SBT to re-compile my Git dependency when it gets updated. In other words: if I make an update to the dependency, push to Git and reload my project's SBT and run <code>package</code>, then SBT does not recompile the external Git dependency when compiling my project.</p>

<p>I've tried creating a new branch in my Git dependency (say, <code>forcenew</code>) and updating the branch in my SBT project configuration to use this:</p>

<pre><code>lazy val depProject = RootProject(uri(""git://github.com/me/dep-project.git#forcenew""))
</code></pre>

<p>But even this doesn't force a refresh. I'm a bit stumped - I can't even find where SBT puts the Git project to compile it (it doesn't seem to be in <code>~/.sbt/</code> or <code>~/.ivy2/</code>)...</p>

6036674,Make site URL without extension while keeping the server organized?,"<p>I have my personal website using Drupal CMS, for the sake of organization I installed drupal in it's own folder in the public_html folder. But when people access my site, I don't want it to show as: <a href=""http://nside-elite.techiedesign.net/drupal6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nside-elite.techiedesign.net/drupal6/</a> I want it to look just like: <a href=""http://nside-elite.techiedesign.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nside-elite.techiedesign.net</a> despite the fact that the whole site per-say is inside a sub folder. </p>

<p>I already setup a redirect, so even if you type in the site name without the extension, it takes you to the right place. It's just not very attractive to have the home page looking like its in a sub directory. </p>

"
6036675,Automated Server cloning and deployment,"<p>I have an ERP system that requires a local installation on a Windows Terminal Server to operate properly.  Right now I pay for each TS that I have the vendor install the software on directly.  However, every time an upgrade happens they take all of my Terminal Servers down for hours.  This happens at least once a month.  Obviously this is not ideal.  As a solution to this issue (since we cannot install the software ourselves), we are doing the following process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have the ERP vendor install the software on one Terminal Server.</li>
<li>Clone/Sysprep that Terminal Server.</li>
<li>Deploy the clone to multiple physical and virtual boxes (with new names, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>This allows us to keep the Terminal Servers running during and upgrade, it keeps the vendor off of our live systems, and it reduces our costs.  However, it makes a lot of manual work for us and during that time we cannot use the ERP system since the database has been updated but the client has not been updated.</p>

<p>I am looking for an automation solution that could handle this process.  Obviously I would like the whole things to be automated and scheduled but even partial automation would be great (or a set of solutions that all work towards automation).  I'm not afraid of scripting or buying something.  Here are the areas the solution needs to handle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scheduled imaging of a server.</li>
<li>Sysprep of the image.</li>
<li>Installation of the image as a clone on multiple systems (preferably multicast).</li>
<li>Basic server setup (Name, IP, join to domain, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now we are using Windows Server 2008 64-bit as our Terminal Server.  At some point we will need to upgrade to R2.  We are also using roaming profiles so there shouldn't be an issue with profiles on the boxes.  We are using a mix of Hyper-V and physical boxes.</p>

<p>If you need more information, please let me know.  As I stated above, I'll buy something if it will do the job.  If you do know of a solution, the more information you provide, the better.  Thanks for your help.</p>

6036690,How can I narrow down the point of failure in this ASP.NET ASMX to Exchange 2010 Managed API setup?,"<p>Since working with Exchange Web Services 2010 is a bit ridiculous, especially from anything other than .NET, I've been tasked with wrapping some functionality up in a SOAP web service that acts as a pass-through for other languages to interact with our Exchange environment.</p>

<p>In order to not require the user to enter their password for every action, we're using impersonation accounts so that all we need is the account name for the account we want to modify.</p>

<p>This all works pretty well. <strong>With one of the impersonation accounts.</strong> Impersonation accounts have a 1:1 relationship with api keys for auditing simplicity purposes. The other impersonation accounts we've setup appear to be exact copies of the working account, except for the different name and password, but when we attempt to use them from the EWS Managed API, we get this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Request failed. The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.</p>

<p>As I said, this same code works fine when using an API key corresponding to a certain other impersonation account; and if I set the non-working api key to use the working impersonation account then the api key starts working.</p>

<p>Since one account works and another doesn't, I would take this to mean that the problem is not in my web service code, but rather in either the impersonation account setup or some sort of configuration that exists in between the web and Exchange servers. But if it were configuration between servers, I'd think that would stop all accounts from working.</p>

<p>At the same time, we have what I believe to be some <em>very</em> competent exchange admins, and at least two of them have looked at the impersonation accounts and come to the conclusion that they are not the problem.</p>

<p>Where can we go from here? I suppose one possible solution would be to channel all requests through the working impersonation account and deal with the auditing implications, but if we <strong>can</strong> avoid that, we'd like to. Any ideas?</p>

6036706,Digital phone system with dual star topology (over Cat5e),"<p>Scenario: 
2 office spaces within the same building (approx 50m apart), 8 workstations in office 1 and 6 workstations in office 2. Every workstation will have 2 network connections (1 for data, 1 for a phone). </p>

<p>The data network I am happy with - 1 switch in each office with a link between them, each workstation connects its local switch.</p>

<p>My question is can I achieve a similar dual star topology for the phone system ? i.e. one cat5 link cable between offices instead of having to run 6 separate cables from office 2 back to office 1 where the phone system will be located (pictured) ?</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pgbxi.jpg"" alt=""network map""></p>

<p>If so, how would I implement it ? What hardware would be required ?</p>

6036711,jQuery - Trying to load everything / an cache issue,"<p><strong>My first problem :</strong> 
I am currently using <code>$(window).load</code> to delay the page render in order to load <strong>all</strong> images and then show it.</p>

<p>It does work with all <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags But <strong>it is not working</strong> with <strong>div tags that have background image</strong>. Lets say I have 30 image on my website template and 10 of them are from <code>background</code> specified in CSS.</p>

<p>Using the <code>$(window).load</code> function, 20 of those <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> images are loaded before the function fires. But the remaining 10 will be loaded when the page starts showing. So the webpage looks very ugly before it is completed.</p>

<p>How can I include those in my <code>windows.load</code> function?</p>

<p><strong>Second problem:</strong>
Because I started making a webpage <strong>from scratch</strong> for the first time, <strong>the pages have a cache issue.</strong> I am going to explain what I mean.</p>

<p>The problem is that after I <strong>change something</strong> in HTML (adding or removing images, etc ... ) When I <strong>try to reload</strong> the page on my browser to <strong>see the changes</strong>, The web page goes into crazy mode and it's messed up. <strong>Unless I do a Full Refresh ( CTRL + F5 )</strong>. It doesn't matter which browser I am using, The page looks messed up after doing either a small or big change in the HTML code.</p>

<p>This is not something normal in my situation. All website on the www are changing their template or part of their page every day/week and It looks so fine everything to enter.
I haven't published my website yet, If I go doing changes on the code every time the user will see weird page.</p>

<p>What's happening ?</p>

6036713,AsyncTask over Multiple Activities?,"<p>Hey guys, I could only find 1 thread on this, and it didn't really answer my question, so I'm asking for myself.</p>

<p>My application is downloading and parsing an rss file, and I've obviously decided to do this in a background task. I chose AsyncTask, and I'm trying to get it to start the download and then bring up the list view for the rss feed. From there I'd like the AsyncTask from the other activity to pass the now parsed information to the new list view activity as it loads it. I can't figure out how to pass a reference to my AsyncTask object to my new activity without implementing parcelable and adding it to the bundle which would be a huge mess I think. Is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>I've also seen other people recommend starting a service. What would be the advantages to doing it this way? Thanks!</p>

fflush(file);

<p>Is there a similar way to do this in a recursive function without naming it again (just to cut down on maintenance)?</p>

<p>After some setting up, the method _UpdateForexQuote would distribute the coming info into properties of RealTimeBar class. Everything is fine. </p>

<p>When I start the program, it does not update. I thought that there is no data coming in. But when I randomly click somewhere in the A1cell of gridcontrol, then click another B1cell, the previous A1cell would update. Then if i click C1cell, then the B1cell would update. If you do not click one cell , it would never update. I show you the picture:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/WHce5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, that after clicking first three lines, the first three lines showed delayed data and since I never touch the fourth line, it shows zero. And the condition is that I just clicked the fifth line Low cell, that is why the Low does not update but other cells updated. It is very strange. I use same code before under devexpress 11 with vs 2010. But now with devexpress 12 with vs 2012, I met this problem which never occurred before. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Below is the method I use to 1. define bindinglist and a hashtable, 2. put objects into the hashtable first and add the object from hashtable to bindinglist 3. bind the bindinglist to gridcontrol.</p>

6036724,pdftex and javascript forms with automatic calculations,"<p>I would like to create a PDF document in TeX with a form.  Some of the fields in the form will be calculated based on the values of other fields.  </p>

<p>Here is a MWE, thanks to <a href=""http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2006-June/006644.html"">Victor Ivrii on the pdftex mailing list</a> back in 2005:</p>

<pre><code>\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
\begin{document}
\begin{Form}

\TextField[maxlen=40,keystroke={AFNumber_Keystroke(2, 0, 1, 2,
true);},align=2,height=10pt,width=45pt,name=alpha]{Alpha}

\bigskip
\TextField[maxlen=40,keystroke={AFNumber_Keystroke(2, 0, 1, 2,
true);},align=2,height=10pt,width=45pt,name=beta]{Beta}


\bigskip
\TextField[maxlen=40,keystroke={AFNumber_Keystroke(2, 0, 1, 2, true);},
calculate={AFSimple_Calculate(""SUM"" , new Array ( ""alpha"" , ""beta"" )
;)},  align=2,height=10pt,width=45pt,name=gamma,readonly=true]{Gamma}
\end{Form}
\end{document}
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting PDF has three fields, and the third is supposed to automatically update to be the sum of the first two.  If I compile the document and open in Acrobat, I can edit the first two fields (<code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>) but the third (<code>gamma</code>) does not update.  No JavaScript errors are thrown.</p>

<p>If I examine the properties of the field <code>gamma</code> in Acrobat, I can see that its <code>calculate</code> property is set to be the sum of the to fields <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>.  </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/bid7j.png"" alt=""Acrobat window and dialog""></p>

<p>If I select ""Pick..."", I'm shown a dialog with the three fields, and <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code> are selected.  If I deselect and <em>reselect</em> those fields and accept, the form now works as desired (<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/109720332/Ivrii-Fixed"">Acrobat-altered document at scribd</a>).  The <code>diff</code> command tells me the PDF file has changed but not how.</p>

<p>I have found some discussion about this on the pdftex mailing list, in the above referenced thread and again <a href=""http://osdir.com/ml/tex.pdftex/2005-08/msg00014.html"">here</a>.  Ralf Uterman apparently posted a <a href=""http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/~ralfu/pdf-forms/"">patch</a> as a result of the second thread, but as far as I can tell the issue persists.  I have tried the <code>eforms</code>  package from the <a href=""http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acrotex"">AcroTeX bundle</a> as well, but the author writes in the <a href=""http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/acrotex/doc/eformman.pdf"">manual</a> that ""Calculate works correctly when drivers <code>dvips</code>, <code>dvipsone</code>, or <code>dvipdfm</code> are used."" (<code>pdftex</code> is not listed).</p>

<p>Yet I cannot get this to work under any driver.  If I use the <code>dvips</code> driver to compile to DVI, then <code>dvips</code> to convert to PostScript, then convert to PDF using either Acrobat Distiller, I get the same non-functioning form as with <code>pdftex</code>.  If I use the <code>dvipdf</code> driver, then <code>dvipdf</code> to convert to PDF, all the form elements are unrecognized and ignored.</p>

<p>This document is going to be stamped over a scanned PDF so I really need no other output except the form and some basic marks.  So I'm flexible as to engine, driver, etc., but so far I'm not getting anything to work without manual intervention via Acrobat.  I'm aware of the related question “ <a href=""http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/36630/hyperref-how-to-format-text-in-a-forms-text-field/40360#40360"">hyperref: how to format text in a forms text-field</a> ” but I can't get the calculations to work in the accepted answer there, either.</p>

6036726,Correctly use stencil_texturing in OpenGL,"<p>I am trying to implement the stencil_texturing extension of OpenGL as a proof of concept. My video card supports up to GL 4.3 so stencil_texturing is available to me. If more clarification is necessary here is the spec provided: <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/stencil_texturing.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/stencil_texturing.txt</a>.</p>

<p>So the goal of my test is to render my color buffer to a texture in frame 0, then the depth buffer in frame 1 and finally the stencil buffer in frame 2. The easy part is done and I have my color and depth buffer textures rendered fine. My issue lies with the stencil buffer and I believe the issue is coming from either my lack of understanding stencil buffers (which could very well be the case) or is my misuse of stencil_texturing. I tried to find some info online but there is very little available.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of what I am rendering here are my current frame captures:
<a href=""http://imgur.com/LVLmWPv"" rel=""nofollow"">Color buffer</a>, <a href=""http://imgur.com/MmsZFD2"" rel=""nofollow"">Depth buffer</a>, <a href=""http://imgur.com/E2utHpZ"" rel=""nofollow"">Stencil buffer</a></p>

<p>So my vision for the stencil buffer is to just stencil out the middle triangle, so everything in the middle triangle has a value of 1 and every part of the texture has a value of 0. I am not sure how this will come up when rendering but I imagine the areas with a stencil value of 1 will be different than those with 0. </p>

<p>Here is my code below. It is just a test class that I throw into a framework I made for them. I believe the only thing not definied is GLERR() which basically calls glGetError() to make sure everything is correct.</p>

6036729,SLES partitionless Installation,"<p>Windows VMWare guests can easily be resized live. For linux guests I've used LVM (add disk, partprobe, add disk to vg, lvextend, resize2fs). This works.</p>

<p>I've just stumbled across the sketch of better approaches. The first seems eminently doable, use LVM physical volume without partitions. This allows extending with one extra volume (and significanly simpler and less work). It'd be even better if I could whittle it down to s single VMDK</p>

<p>The more tantilizing option though is hinted at in a couple of posts scattered about the internet (including the unix cousin of this sight) running off of a partitionless VMDK. This seems very clean, but I'm running into a major roadblock for testing (and implementation) installing to a partionless system. </p>

<p>We are a SLES/OES shop, this may well be easy with another distro, but I cannot get the installer to skip partitioning. I've tried presenting it with preformatted whole disk and various permutations of the SLES installation disk formatting process.</p>

<p>My desired tab delimited output text is like the following table when open in Excel</p>

<p><a href=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_Wsib_NwEZrA/TU6vzqbEGDI/AAAAAAAAAU0/V1SfGJyXJhQ/s800/2011-02-06_185321.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_Wsib_NwEZrA/TU6vzqbEGDI/AAAAAAAAAU0/V1SfGJyXJhQ/s800/2011-02-06_185321.png</a></p>

<p>I was given a XSLT file to do the conversion. However, it can only handle simple, straight-forward XML structure.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;

<p>I like to have an improved version so that </p>

<ul>
<li>field names are shown as column
headers</li>
<li>for date : the display value is used,
not the numbers</li>
<li>for categories: all the categories
displayed in separate columns</li>
<li>for empty data: empty cell is shown</li>
</ul>

<p>I have limited XML knowledge. Hope someone can assist. Thanks :-)</p>

<p>The XSLT provided has worked very well until I tested on some new fields. Below is the XML exported from the system. It consists of two records.</p>

<p>There are three areas that I like to improve.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Previously, only the Category field has multi values. Now, other field can have multi values too. In this example, the field name is <strong>Test multi-select string list</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Instead of breaking the multi values into different columns, insert separators between the values e.g. use | or some other characters that we can define</p></li>
<li><p>As can be seen, there are two multi level fields: Test Table Field and User Comment Thread. Hope that the improved XSLT can handle this type of filed</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit on 26 Apr 2011</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have solved this successfully by duplicating the last 3 templates and renaming ns:CategoryValue to ns:EnumValue </p></li>
<li><p>Your solution works. Thanks! </p></li>
<li><p>Sorry that I did not explain clearly. I just need all the multi-level fields and data to be transformed like the rest of the fields. That is, one column for one field. I do not care about their nested relationship</p></li>

6036734,"""Lost connection to MySQL server"" error, but 1 hour after actual occurrence?","<p>During high load on our platform we start seeing some errors from MySQL in our logs. The strange thing about these errors are they appear in the logs exactly 1 hour (3600 seconds) after they actually occurred.</p>

<p>For example, we did a load test the other day, and at around 8.30am we hit a bottle neck and things started timing out. Exactly 1 hour later at 9.30am we started seeing the following lines in our logs,</p>

I am however very aware I'm probably going down the wrong road here.</p>

6036737,Caching images with different query strings (S3 signed urls),"<p>I'm trying to figure out if I can get browsers to cache images with signed urls.</p>

<p>What I want is to generate a new signed url for every request (same image, but with an updated signature), but have the browser not re-download it every time.</p>

<p>So, assuming the cache-related headers are set correctly, and all of the URL is the same except for the query string, is there any way to make the browser cache it?</p>

<p>The urls would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>http://example.s3.amazonaws.com/magic.jpg?WSAccessKeyId=stuff&amp;Signature=stuff&amp;Expires=1276297463

<p>We plan to set the e-tags to be an md5sum, so will it at least figure out it's the same image at that point?</p>

<p>My other option is to keep track of when last gave out a url, then start giving out new ones slightly before the old ones expire, but I'd prefer not to deal with session info.</p>

<p>As you can see, this code also adds relevant Google Cross-Domain tracking attributes to links and forms but the issue is that my conversion script for remarketing isn't working. There are no Javascript errors but also no people showing in my remarketing list, we get around 50 visits to our site every couple of minutes so they should be there...</p>

<p>Basically, the software is our core product and I have been hired to do a major re-factor (amongst other things).  It's a massive task and I can't just dive in and fix all the little things.. I need an overall strategy.  I've written some scripts to tidy indentation up, removed commented-out code everywhere and made the project into a repo but now it's time to do the real stuff.</p>

<p>I kind of have a vague idea but not sure how to go about it.  I could somehow leave the current code alone and write some layer of software over it that abstracts away from all the horribleness.  It would be good if the new layer was some sort of MVC architecture.  At the same time I would go into the current code, remove redundancies because otherwise the new layer would be using bad code anyway so the code could slow down even more.</p>

<p>As you can see.. need some clues/hints/tips/advice/experiences!</p>

6036749,Adding custom view with conditional base class to a NIB in Interface Builder,"<p>We are building an SDK that is centered around a custom view that is available for both iOS and OSX. We want our users to be able to use this view in the exact same way on iOS and OSX. On OSX, this view inherits from NSOpenGLView and on iOS, it inherits from a UIView.</p>

<p>So the hierarchy looks like this...</p>

<pre><code>              CustomView
                     ^
                     |
                     |
           CustomViewBase
                     ^
                  /     \
                 /       \
                /         \
       (OSX)   /           \ (iOS)
        NSOpenGLView    UIView 
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is that if I try to add a view to my NIB and specify in the inspector that it's backing class is CustomView, it can't find it and the class name keeps falling back to UIView/NSOpenGLView in the inspector because in CustomViewBase.h we have this:</p>

<pre><code>#if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
  @interface CustomViewBase : UIView
#elif TARGET_OS_MAC &amp;&amp; !TARGET_OS_IPHONE
  @interface CustomViewBase : NSOpenGLView
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>and apparently IB can't determine that this project is targeting iOS/OSX so we either can't hook up the IBOutlet, or else if we create the outlet by ctrl dragging from IB and manually specifying the class name, it will crash because it actually just creates a UIView and eventually sends a selector meant for our custom view to it.</p>

6036752,Java app calls C++ DLL via JNI; how best to allocate memory?,"<p>Basic summary of question is:
How do I best optimize my memory allocation to give as much memory to the DLLs I access through JNI as possible?  What should I aim to minimize, what should I aim to maximize, etc.</p>

<p>SYSTEM:
Running JBoss 6 as a Windows 32 Service in a 32-bit system with 4 GB RAM.  I do understand there are maximum restrictions on memory for Java Heap.  JVM is <strong>JRE1.6.0_26</strong></p>

<p>SERVICE:
Installed under JBoss is a webapp which receives requests from clients; each request calls the C++-built DLL through JNI to process an image file in some fashion or other.  </p>

<p>ISSUE:
Occasionally, with larger or some (not all) LZW-compression images, the calling java class receives a message that the DLL experienced a Global Memory Depletion and failed to complete the requested process.</p>

<p>There is nothing else actively running on the server beyond basic windows processes.</p>

<p>Current JBOSS App Server memory settings are as follows, but may be excessive:</p>

<p>-Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -Xss1024k -XX:MaxPermSize=128m </p>

<p>I am trying to determine the best memory settings to give as much resources to the JNI DLL, as I understand JNI does not use any memory allocated to the Java Heap.</p>

<p>I have read these, but did not find them helpful to answer my question:</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5986645/java-jni-memory-allocation-partitioning"">Java JNI : Memory allocation / partitioning</a></p>

6036756,Sort files in a directory,"<p>I have a hardware mp3 player which seems to play the tracks in the order they were stored in the file system of the player. Hence, if i copy the files 01.mp3, 03.mp3 and 02.mp3 to the player in that order, they will be played in that very same order.</p>

<p>Which is annoying.</p>

<p>If copy a whole directory containing mp3-files to the player from a computer of mine running UNIX, the cp program will copy the files in whatever order the filenames are stored in that directory. My solution to this is to either copy the files of the directory one by one in the desired order, or by ""sorting"" the directory by creating new links to the files in the desired order, removing the old links and then renaming. This leaves me with a new set of links that are sorted.</p>

<p>I am aware of the fact that this ""method of sorting"" is highly unreliable as the only thing it relies on is the way the OS of my very computer manages directories. But, it does work.</p>

<p>Now, i have noticed that Windows seems to treat the files in directories in the same way as cp does. If i drag and drop a directory from a harddisk to my mp3 player, the files will be copied in the order they were created on the disk.</p>

<p>Of course, i am not able to port the program that sorts directories as Windows does not comply with POSIX (and a lot of other reasons), and even if it would be possible, i am not sure that i could exploit NTFS in the way i would like. Before i dig into this, i would like to ask if it is possible to fiddle with NTFS like i have been doing. I would also like to know if there are any better ways to accomplish my goal, which simply is to have the mp3 tracks played in the right order.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @expectedException PHPUnit_Framework_Error
 */

public function testSetInvalidKey()
 {
     $this-&gt;assertEquals(true, conf::set(""invalid_key"", ""12345""));     
 } 
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, but what I don't understand is that any additional assertion within that function will <em>not</em> be evaluated. Whether it would fail or not, PHPUnit seems to <em>only</em> wait for the exception to happen, and be satisfied with the whole function when it has happened. </p>

<p>To wit, this test will run OK:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @expectedException PHPUnit_Framework_Error
 */

 public function testSetInvalidKey()
 { 
   // The error will be triggered here
   $this-&gt;assertEquals(true, conf::set(""invalid_key"", ""12345""));                      
   $this-&gt;assertEquals(12345, 67810);   // Huh?    
   $this-&gt;assertEquals(""abc"", ""def"");   // Huh?
   $this-&gt;assertEquals(true, false);    // Huh?

 }
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Is this the intended behaviour? </p>

<p>I realize you would just separate the assertions into different functions, but I would like to understand the behaviour.</p>

6036765,MSChart: How to group RangeBar data with text labels instead of indexes?,"<p>I'm looking to plot data on a RangeBar chart area (System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting) and I'm having issues grouping the data when I have text values for the labels on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>Here's the pertinent code:</p>

<pre><code>var connectedTimeRangeSeries = theChart.Series.Add(""ConnectedTimeRangeSeries"");
var connectedTimeRangesChartArea = theChart.ChartAreas[""PerItemConnectedChartArea""];

connectedTimeRangeSeries.ChartArea = connectedTimeRangesChartArea.Name;
connectedTimeRangeSeries.ChartType = SeriesChartType.RangeBar;
connectedTimeRangeSeries.XValueType = ChartValueType.Auto;
connectedTimeRangeSeries.YValueType = ChartValueType.Auto;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; timeRanges.Count; i++)
{
    string theLabel = timeRanges[i].ItemLabel;

    connectedTimeRangeSeries.Points.AddXY(timeRanges[i].ItemId + 1, timeRanges[i].StartConnectionTime, timeRanges[i].StopConnectionTime);
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>timeRanges</code> is a list with items having these member types (accessed through public properties with corresponding capitalized names):</p>

<pre><code>private int itemId;
private string itemLabel;
private DateTime startConnectionTime;
private DateTime stopConnectionTime;
</code></pre>

<p>When I call <code>DataSeries.Points.AddXY()</code> with the X type as an integer (recall X is the vertical axis on the range bar) it does what I want.  The time ranges are grouped according to the index in the bottom graph:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/7VOrO.jpg"" alt=""good chart""></p>

<p>However, when I change to try to use a text label to group them, by replacing <code>AddXY</code> with this:</p>

<pre><code>connectedTimeRangeSeries.Points.AddXY(theLabel, timeRanges[i].StartConnectionTime, timeRanges[i].StopConnectionTime);
</code></pre>

<p>the data are no longer grouped:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/B13js.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>It's like each one gets its own bin, and I just want them to be combined by label.  (Each index has one and only one label.)</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Thanks!</p>

<p>Could someone walk me through a solution to Ex 2.8?</p>

<p>2.7:  Bill tosses a bent coin $N$ times, obtaining a sequence of heads and tails.  We assume that the coin has a probability $f_H$ of coming up heads; we do not know $f_H$.  If $n_H$ heads have occurred in $N$ tosses, what is the probability distribution of $f_H$? ...What is the probability that the $N+1$th outcome will be a head, given $n_H$ heads in $N$ tosses?</p>

<p>2.8:  Assuming a uniform prior on $f_H$, $P(f_H)=1$, solve the problem posed in 2.7.  Sketch the distribution of fH and compute the probability that the $N+1$th outcome will be a head, for
(A) $N=3$ and $n_H$=0;
(B) $N=3$ and $n_H=2$;
(C) $N=10$ and $n_H=3$;
(D) $N=300$ and $n_H=29$.</p>

<p>{tip about the beta integral}</p>

<p>Where I am stuck is with the switch to continuous probabilities, and using integrals rather than sums.  Had no problem with 2.4; 2.5 took some doing but was fine.  The example in 2.6 made sense walking through it.</p>

<p>In working on 2.8, I can write down that posterior = (likelihood x prior) / evidence, and know that I am trying to solve for posterior (to find the distribution of $f_H$).  So my equation will look something like</p>

<p>$$P(f_H |\,n_H, N) = {P(n_H|\,f_H, N) P(f_H) \over P(n_H|\,N)}$$.</p>

<p>The left hand side of the numerator should just be the binomial probability </p>

<p>${N \choose n_H}$ $f_H^{n_H}$ $(1-f_H)^{N-n_H}$  Based on the statement in the question, I assume that $P(f_H) = 1$ and ignore it.</p>

<p>The denominator is the marginal probability of $n_H$.  I believe this should be an integral - something like $\int_0^1 P(f_H) P(n_H |\,f_H, N) df_H$.  But I am not sure that this is correct, and am not sure how to solve it, even with the hints.</p>

<p>I did notice that 2.7 is an <i>example</i> and the additional assumptions - but need help here too.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>Probably worth noting that there was no need to shrink the DB to reduce the size of backup. Just removing the data is good enough. Our backups are now 9gb.</p>

<p>So far, so good...  And the application has data (items2) according to user's selection on <strong>firstTable</strong> that needs to be populated into <strong>secondTable</strong>.  But how?</p>

<p>After reading several dozen topics here and there, I've learnt that there are a couple of ways by which you can pass data.  Well, in this case, I can't use <strong>segue</strong> since I'm passing data within the same view control.  Anyway, it seems that some people here suggest that I do it either with <strong>Delegate</strong> and <strong>NSNotification</strong>.  And it looks like using a delegate is appropriate in my case.  Again, how?  Is it the same idea with use of a popover window where I think I've used a delegate?</p>

<p>I appreciate your advice.</p>

6036807,Symfony2 multiple applications and api centric application,"<p>I'm trying to do a Symfony2 centric application and re-use all the Bundles for the web front app. The application will be divided in three API, FrontEnd, BackEnd, so that we can code the API like a Service Bundle and use it across the hole application and also will provide an API for our application. The FrontEnd will use the API as a Service and it will have all the front for user use. And the BackEnd will also use the API but providing a different url to admin the app.</p>

The problem is that jq change event triggers in IE9 and Chrome only from the user input, eg, when you actually enter or select some values.

What does it mean for $\{f_j\}$ to converge c-uniformly to y in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}^n\setminus \{x\}$?

6036826,When should you use `@+id` instead of `@id`?,"<p>I have a bunch of <code>View</code>s in a <code>&lt;merge&gt;</code>, and I included that <code>&lt;merge&gt;</code> into a <code>RelativeLayout</code>. I try to refer to the IDs of those included <code>View</code>s to act as anchors for my other <code>View</code>s, but Eclipse complains that the IDs are not resolving. I found a workaround by using <code>@+id</code> rather than <code>@id</code> when I first <strong>refer</strong> to them rather than when I actually define the objects they refer to. I've already defined the two <code>ID</code>s in a <code>Style</code> and in the included <code>&lt;merge&gt;</code> where they are declared, so it feels a bit inefficient if I keep repeating the definition of the ID. </p>

<p>Is this the correct way of doing it? I'm assuming it's bad cause the '+' is another initialization. My current hypothesis is that you should use <code>@+id</code> when you first <strong>use</strong> the ID rather than when you <strong>initialize</strong> the object that the ID is going to represent, a bit like <code>C/C++</code> and how they require at least a function  prototype in the lines prior to the actual code that uses the function.</p>

<p>Another question I have is when you use the GUI-based UI builder of Eclipse, I noticed that they always use <code>@+id</code> rather than <code>@id</code>. Is this acceptable, cause it seems inefficient to me; it's as if the application will be spending more time determining whether or not the ID has been declared in <code>R.id</code>.</p>

Stranger still, certain sites would always work while others would always fail.  Trying to ping ""working"" sites succeeded, but trying to ping ""broken"" sites failed.</p>

<p>Long story short, I beat my head against this for <em>days</em> and finally noticed that while my wireless adapter's config said it was using the correct default gateway (192.168.1.1), <code>ipconfig /all</code> listed <em>two</em> default gateways -- the other was 192.168.1.89.

Using my own data, I get this map</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TvOnv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On top of this surface map, I would like to add a map of vegetation density such that I obtain something like this (obtained with the software Surfer):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nax24.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is it possible to do this with rgl, or for that matter any other package in r or is the only solution to have two maps like in Shane's answer? </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> </p>

<p>Following @gsk3's request, here is the code for this map:</p>

# Read the z (i.e. elevation) dimension from file
z1 = matrix(scan(""myfile.txt""),nrow=256, ncol=256, byrow=TRUE)
#create / open x y (i.e. easting and northing coordinates) dimensions 
y=8*(1:ncol(z)) # Each point is 8 m^2
x=8*(1:nrow(z))

# See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1896419/plotting-a-3d-surface-plot-with-contour-map-overlay-using-r for details of code below

col &lt;- colorlut[ z-zlim[1]+1 ] # assign colors to heights for each point
open3d()
rgl.surface(x,y,z)

<p>I can't post the elevation code because there are 65536 (i.e. x*y=256*256) points but it is a matrix which looks like this</p>

<pre><code>            [,1]     [,2]     [,3]     [,4]     [,5]

6036830,"Trying to move an ImageView in a touch event via setLayoutParams, imageview is not moving","<p>I've got a small ImageView inside of a fullscreen FrameLayout, and I'd like to set it such that when I touch the FrameLayout, the imageview moves to that position. </p>

<p>I've read all the other SO questions I can find about moving ImageView but I haven't seen why my solution is not working yet. </p>

6036831,Is using multiple tables an advisable solution to dealing with user defined fields?,"<p>I am looking at a problem which would involve users uploading lists of records with various field structures into an application. The 2nd part of this would be to also allow the users to specify fields to capture information.</p>

<p>This is a step beyond anything ive done up to this point where i would have designed a static RDMS structure myself. In some respects all records will be treated the same so there will be some common fields required for each. Almost all queries will be run on these common fields.</p>

<p>My first thought would be to dynamically generate a new table for each import and another for each data capture field spec.Then have a master table with a guid for every record in the application along with the common fields and then fields that specify the name of the table the data was imported to and name of table with the data capture fields. </p>

<p>Further information (metadata?) about the fields in the dynamically generated tables could be stored in xml or in a 'property' table. </p>

<p>This would mean as users log into the application i would be dynamically choosing which table of data to presented to the user, and there would be a large number of tables in the database if it was say not only multiuser but then multitennant.</p>

<p>My question is are there other methods to solving this kind of varaible field issue, im i going down an unadvised path here?</p>

<p>I believe that EAV would require me to have a table defining the fields for each import / data capture spec and then another table with the import - field - values data and that seems impracticle.</p>

6036833,MAX/ORDER BY on char column,"<p>in my SQL Server 2005 database I have a column <code>RMA_Number</code> with datatype char(10) in table <code>RMA</code>.</p>

<p>The value is an increasing number with the format <code>RMA0002511</code>. What is the fastest way to get the highest number to increment it on inserting?</p>

<p>My first approach was:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT     TOP (1) RMA_Number
FROM         RMA
WHERE     (RMA_generated = 1)
ORDER BY Creation_Date DESC
</code></pre>

<p>But this was error-prone because it was somehow possible that a higher RMA_Number has an earlier creation date. As a workaround, sorting by the primary key works:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT     TOP (1) RMA_Number
FROM         RMA
WHERE     (RMA_generated = 1)
ORDER BY idRMA DESC
</code></pre>

<p>But maybe this is also a possible  source of error. </p>

<p>Logically the best way would be to <code>ORDER BY RMA_Number DESC</code>. </p>

<p>But because I was not sure if this gives always the correct result and thought that sorting a char column could get slow if the number of records increase, I chose to order by the Date column.</p>

<p>So, </p>

<ol>
<li>is it a good idea to order by a char(10)-column (performance and accuracy)?</li>
<li>would it be better to <code>SELECT MAX( RMA_Number ) FROM RMA</code> to get the highest number(perf. and accuracy)</li>
<li>should I stick on using the primary key to order by if the first two points are wrong or should I use an <code>int</code> column and format the number in the application?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>I think I must clarify something that I haven't mentioned. The RMA_Number is not generated on every insert. So maybe there are many records without a number. Martin uses the primary key to build the number. That would be a problem, because the gaps would be too big.</p>

6036835,Temporarily clearing untracked files before commit in Git,"<p>Whenever I commit, I worry that I may have missed out a dependency and I'm looking for the simplest way to test my git tree in isolation to ensure whatever is in the git index (""staged"") will in fact compile/run on their own.</p>

<p>My code's dependencies exist in the filesystem from where I do the 'git add' and so simple compiling and running tests doesn't guarantee that whatever I checkin would compile/run if the tree (or staging area) was checkout out onto a clean filesystem.</p>

<p>I could have a continuous build that would check after submission but I prefer not to have any bad commits in the history that I later have to patch. I therefore want a way of creating an isolated environment that includes a checkout of the tree as well as the index/staging area.</p>

<p>One thing I've considered is using git stash twice, i.e.:</p>

<ol>
<li>Invoke 'git stash' to save the files in the index</li>
<li>Somehow get a list of the files not tracked, 'git add' all these files, save a new stash</li>
<li>Delete all the previously untracked files</li>
<li>Restore the original stash</li>
<li>I should now have a clean environment that has only the code already checked-in and the code in the staging area which I can compile &amp; test.</li>
<li>Once finished, I restore the stash of the untracked files and then untrack them to leave me in the same position that I was in originally.</li>
</ol>

<p>(These untracked files may be useful but not necessarily things I want to check in to the repository - e.g. eclipse projects).</p>

6036837,How do I serialize telnet like communication on a bidirectional socket connection?,"<p>I have implemented TCP/IP communication between a VB and VC++ programs running on the same machine. On the VC++ side I spawn a thread which listens for connections. On the VB side I use the Winsock API to connect to the C++ server. Everything seems to work fine, especially when I manually debug and step through the communication. The protocol is text based, commands terminate on '\n' and may or may not have an answer.</p>

<p>And here is the problem. I'm trying to implement commands which are sent to the server, this requires some processing and the server sends them back to the client. Under simple conditions this works fine, but under heavy load or different machine configurations sometimes the communication gets interrupted.</p>

<p>The client may be sending a command but the server may be sending the answer of a previous command. The VB client somehow gets a fragmented answer (say, instead of a ""DATA RECEIVED"" it gets ""EIVED"") which breaks the state machine I've implemented to track the connection.</p>

<p>So far I've been able to talk to the webservice: and receive something along those lines</p>

<p>I have access to the SQL Server 2005 server which is remote and i know i can insert into it but given that now i have a one-to-many relationship i want to be able to rollback if something fails.</p>

<p>So in short how can I insert from this XML into the DB preferably without manually walking through the XML tree?</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be able to use Entity and Session Beans or maybe JAXB bindings but I'm simply not being successful.</p>

<p>One of the reasons might have something to do with the fact that the soap response contains an array of CreditCardSettlements and each of which contains an array of Batches and DeductionItems</p>

<p>It would be best if someone can help me do this via a BPEL in GlassFish OpenESB but any hint at a java solution is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Specifically, I need to compute the representatives when $G=Sp_4(\mathbb{F}_q)$ (I'm using $J$ the anti diagonal with top two entries $1$, and the other two $-1$), $H_1$ is the parabolic with $4=2+2$, and $H_2=SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)\ltimes H$, where $H$ is the group of matrices of the form:

<p>But nothing is triggered (except when the page load).</p>

<p>I thought: well, let's be crazy and emulate it by :
 1. Detecting touchend
 2. Polling the window.pageYOffset so we know when the window stops scrolling
 3. Manually trigger a user function I want on scroll.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the touchend event doesn't look to be triggered either... in fact, when we don't scroll and only tap the screen (touchstart + touchend), it works. As soon as we scroll the page in between (touchstart + touchmove + touchend), it breaks everything.</p>

<p>Now my most basic example only contains this:</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener('touchend', function(){ alert('test'); }, false);

<p>But the alert doesn't show up when we scroll with the finger and release the touch...</p>

6036867,How to compute $\sum\limits_{n=3}^{\infty}\frac{(n-3)!}{(n+2)!}$,"<p>I came across a question which required us to find $\displaystyle\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^5-5n^3+4n}$. I simplified it to $\displaystyle\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n-2)(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)}$ which simplifies to $\displaystyle\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}\frac{(n-3)!}{(n+2)!}$. I thought it might have something to do with partial fractions, but since I am relatively inexperienced with them I was unable to think of anything useful to do. I tried to check WolframAlpha and it gave $$\sum_{n=3}^{m}\frac{(n-3)!}{(n+2)!}=\frac{m^4+2m^3-m^2-2m-24}{96(m-1)m(m+1)(m+2)}$$
From this it is clear that as $m\rightarrow \infty$ the sum converges to $\frac{1}{96}$, however I have no idea how to get there. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

6036873,Designing around the constraints of external services in a client-server architecture,"<p>Suppose you have a client that interfaces with a server which in turn invokes an external service to fulfill some of the client's requests. I'm designing the client and server and need to accommodate the limitations of the external service. I have these options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Encapsulate (as much as possible) all code dealing with the service's limitations inside the <strong>server</strong> application.</li>
<li>Encapsulate (as much as possible) all code dealing with the service's limitations inside the <strong>client</strong> application.</li>
<li>Design both the client and server applications around the external service's limitations.</li>

<p>I had chosen option #1 because the server application was 'closer' to the external service and I didn't want to have to redesign the client if and when the external service was improved. However, now I'm being asked to choose option #3 by the server-side team so we can deal with the external service limitations in the API instead of by handling exceptions. Is there a design pattern I can reference to convince them (or myself) that one option is preferred?

6036875,MySQL Query - WHERE and IF?,"<p>SOLVED:
Datatypes in the table for country and OS were set to VARCHAR so in my where, I changed = 0 to = '0'.
Thanks to raina77ow for pointing this out! Appreciate it.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure how to write this query. Basically, I'm going to have a table with two columns (OS and country_code) - more columns too, but those are the conditional ones. These will be either set to 0 for all, or specific ones, separated by commas.</p>

<p>Now, what I'm trying achieve is pull data from the table if the OS and country_code = 0, or if they contain matching data (separated by commas).</p>

<p>Then, I have a column for time. I want to select rows where the time is GREATER than the time column, unless the column time_t is set to false, in which case this shouldn't matter.</p>

<p>I hope I explained it right?</p>

<p>This is what I kind of have so far:</p>

<pre><code>$get = $db-&gt;prepare(""SELECT * FROM commands 
    WHERE country_code = 0 OR country_code LIKE :country_code 
    AND OS = 0 OR OS LIKE :OS 
    AND IF (time_t = 1, expiry &gt; NOW())
"");
$get-&gt;execute(array(
    ':country_code' =&gt; ""%{$data['country_code']}%"",
    ':OS' =&gt;  ""%{$data['OS']}%""
));
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: This is the code I'm using now, but I still can't seem to get the OS and Country_code part working:</p>

<pre><code>$get = $db-&gt;prepare(""SELECT * FROM commands 
WHERE (country_code = 0 OR country_code LIKE :country_code) 
AND (OS = 0 OR OS LIKE :OS) 
AND (time_t &lt;&gt; 1 OR expiry &gt; NOW())
"");

$get-&gt;execute(array(
':country_code' =&gt; ""%{$data['country_code']}%"",
':OS' =&gt;  ""%{$data['OS']}%""
));
</code></pre>

<p>Data sent to the DB would be: 
OS => Windows 7 
country_code => GB 
ONLY one would be being sent, not more than one. The issue I'm having right now is, it's working for OS and for the time thing, but it's not working for the country. I even tried a raw query, when the data in the table is ""FR, SA"" and I did LIKE '%GB%' it still returned the row</p>

6036878,How to Properly Setup a Java Web Applet Using SMTP on a Server,"<p>I need to have a Java web applet send automated emails via SMTP. I am relatively fresh to servers and communication from a programming standpoint. As such, I am not using servlets and am just running the java mail api in my web applet. It runs fine when I run it through Netbeans and am using Glassfish. I want to put it on to a company's server so it can be run from their website.</p>

<p>I know how to embed the applet and such, but I am not sure how the email service will work exactly. From what I understand, I need the appropriate jar files (mail, activation, pop3, etc.) set on the server's classpath, or in a nearby directory while the applet is running. I am supposing this server will do something similar to Glassfish, as I can compile and run everything in the applet outside of netbeans, but get classnotfound/classnotdef errors when the applet attempts to send an email. This would seem due to a lack of a server environment similar to Glassfish.</p>

<p>Again, I am pretty new to this area of server communication and structure, so any guides to help with introductions would be useful. In addition to that, any jump-start advice would also be appreciated to get stuff moving for the time being.</p>

<p>Lastly, what does Glassfish and other services like Apache and Tomcat provide for Netbeans exactly? They seem to be required to developed anything web-related in Netbeans, though I can run applets outside of Netbeans (excluding the mail services), what is it actually doing? Is it a faux server mimicking the processes of a full one? I spent some hours trying to find out more about these things, but there is not a basic how/why for all of this that I have found.</p>

"
6036883,Flex 4 - Reduce amount of nested containers to improve performance,"<p>A very well known fact to improve the performance of a Flex app is to reduce the amount of nested containers, yet doing so seems particularly hard for me to do.</p>

<p>I'm developing a mobile app and resizing some of my components at runtime is quite slow (I can switch components to fullscreen and back again), we're speaking of 500-1000ms, which isn't really nice. Less complex components resize instantly with no noticeable lag, which is what I'd like for all components.</p>

<p>Let's assume the following component (simplified of course and some groups are components by themselves, but the nesting level is quite accurate);</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VGroup ""the component's base""&gt;

   // I guess this is fine
   &lt;HGroup ""the component's title bar""&gt;
       &lt;SkinnableContainer ""title bar skin""&gt;
            &lt;title bar components, labels etc. /&gt;
       &lt;/SkinnableContainer&gt;
   &lt;/HGroup&gt;

   &lt;HGroup ""options bar that has switchable components""&gt;
      &lt;button /&gt;
      &lt;array ""holds 'views' for the options bar that can be switched""&gt;
           &lt;HGroup ""one option view""&gt;
               &lt;option view contents, labels etc. /&gt;
           &lt;/HGroup&gt;
           &lt;HGroup ""another option view""&gt;
               &lt;option view contents, labels etc. /&gt;
           &lt;/HGroup&gt;
      &lt;/array&gt;
     &lt;button /&gt;
   &lt;/HGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's it for the basic component layout. I'm not sure if the options bar can be optimised, the two buttons are used to switch the content which itself is placed between the buttons, hence the upper <code>HGroup</code>. The components inside the array need to be aligned horizontally as well, hence the child <code>HGroup</code>s. That's already down to nesting level 3 in this component, which by itself is already a level 3 container (due to my navigation).</p>

<p>To the component's content area;</p>

<pre><code>     &lt;Group ""this is the content area""&gt;

     // this group needs two different layouts (vertical and horizontal) that
     // are switched based upon the user's choice of having the component maximised
     // or minimised 
     &lt;layouts /&gt;

     // this list changes it's size based on the selected layout
     &lt;List /&gt;

     this group also changes it's size based on the layout
     &lt;VGroup&gt;
        &lt;scroller&gt;
            // the group here holds a large label that needs to be scrollable
            &lt;group&gt;
        &lt;/scroller&gt;
        &lt;HGroup&gt;
            &lt;some basic components like `SkinnableContainer` and `Label` /&gt;
        &lt;/HGroup&gt; 
     &lt;/VGroup&gt;
   &lt;/Group&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And that's pretty much the layout of my worst performing (layout resizing wise) component, closing tag...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/VGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... and we're done.</p>

<p>So the big question, is there room to optimise this? If so, where can I start? Obviously the layout manager has to calculate quite much during the layout switching process.
Unfortunately, since this is a mobile app, I can't work with absolute sizes at all as I need this app to work on a variety of platforms and resolutions, thus all groups have relative sizes assigned, usually 100% for both width and height.</p>

<p>I'd really like to streamline this, but I just don't know where to start. Any tips what I could do?</p>

<p>A friend at the university wants to start a website. He wants to use a university domain name (http://university.com/my-awesome-website). The problem is that I want to build it with WordPress, but the university is still using PHP4, so WP isn't possible!!</p>

<p>Can I setup a <code>.htaccess</code> file or similar so that when someone goes to <a href=""http://university.com/my-awesome-website"" rel=""nofollow"">http://university.com/my-awesome-website</a>, the urls look right, but the pages are actually coming from WordPress on a different server? </p>

<p>Is this what they call 'domain masking' or is it a '301' redirect?  </p>

<p>Help appreciated!</p>

6036889,Making an app with xcode with a map showing a route,"<p>Hello
I need to make an app that shows you your current position on a defined route. As I am new to xCode, I'm just playing around a little bit. I am organizing a walk with an already chosen route. And I want my app to show this route on a map, with the current position of the walker, so that they can see how far it is to the finish line. A little display showing your already walked distance and the distance to go would be nice to.
Could you please give me some tips?

<p>The problem is that my create.js.erb, when rendering the 'unlike' button, doesn't properly load the @liked instance variable, because it's being set in the #show action of the stories controller <em>before</em> the user has liked the story, so I can't figure out how or where to set it so the JS will render the unlike properly.

<p>Here's my problem.  I've inherited a product which has been designed to be so flexible that populating pretty much every combobox and textblock on the (silverlight) form requires a service request.  Some of the screens take upward of 15 separate requests just to populate!</p>

<p>Now I've worked with WCF web services on a number of occasions and having service contracts split into small discrete operations has never been too much of a hit,..sadly this is not the case for this project.  So it left me wondering...</p>

<p>There are <strong>no</strong> plans to expose the service outside of our own walls.  There are <strong>no</strong> plans to write another client for this particular service.  So couldn't I just write a 'use case controller' at the service end?  So, in a 'create complaint' screen, instead of having a list of requests like...</p>

<ol>
<li>GetComplaintTypes</li>
<li>GetCustomerTypes</li>
<li>GetAreaDetails</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ol>

<p>to populate the form I would just have a single operation contract called  'GetCreateComplaintData'.  It seems crazy to have so many operations exposed in such granularity when there's only one client which then has to aggregate and synchronise all these requests into something meaningful.  Why not expose something meaningful in the first place?</p>

<p>More to the point, if you don't intend on exposing the service API to third parties isn't this a better strategy than exposing CRUD ops for tables in the DB?</p>

<p>All help and opinions are appreciated.
Thanks in advance.</p>

However, I feel like there might be some sort of technique involving <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability"" rel=""nofollow"">Bayesian probability</a> to do this.  E.g. something like, ""If finding <code>X</code> in a set within <code>G</code> means there is a high probability of also finding <code>Y</code>, then there is probably a set in <code>H</code> containing both <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>.""</p>

6036911,Typing for a clone method specified in an interface,"<p>I'm writing an interface that requires classes to implement a clone() method. My naive approach to this went along the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>public interface ISolvableGame {
    function clone():ISolvableGame;
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>elsewhere:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyGame implements ISolvableGame {
    public function clone():MyGame {
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I had supposed that this sort of signature would be legal, because <code>MyGame.clone()</code> returns an instance of a class that implements ISolvableGame, which seems to me to satisfy the contract in the interface. However, code like the above generates a compile error, referring to the fact that <code>MyGame.clone()</code> has a different signature than the one specified in the interface. </p>

<p>My question is thus, how can I make an interface requiring a clone method if the implemented method must exactly match the signature in the interface? Obviously making the interface more specific wouldn't make any sense. But if I made the implemented method less specific (i.e. if I typed <code>MyGame.clone()</code> as returning <code>ISolvableGame</code>), other users of that clone method would no longer know what they were getting.</p>

<p>Do I need two versions of the clone method, one typed as <code>ISolvableGame</code> to satisfy the interface and another typed as <code>MyGame</code> for use within the class? Or is there a better approach?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I'm working in ActionScript3 (a Java-like language that implements the ECMA4 spec). I tagged this as language-agnostic in the assumption that AS3 isn't unique in how it treats interfaces. But if my sample code above would work in other languages, then my problem may be specific to my language.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  It occurred to me to examine how the core libraries of my language deal with this. For example, there is an <code>IEventDispatcher</code> interface, which defines a method <code>dispatch():Event</code> - so any class that dispatches a <em>subclass</em> of <code>Event</code> cannot implement <code>IEventDispatcher</code>, which is ultimately similar to my problem.</p>

<p>The core libraries deal with this by instead having such classes <em>inherit</em> from a class <code>EventDispatcher</code>, which exists for the purpose of implementing <code>IEventDispatcher</code>. Thus gaining compile-time type safety, but at the cost of rather diluting the point of using an interface in the first place, since one usually prefers interfaces to avoid problems posed by inheritance.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that my choices are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rely ultimately on inheritance, as the core libraries do</li>
<li>Implement two methods as Frederik describes, with different names</li>
<li>Sacrifice compile-time type safety as James describes</li>
</ul>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the end, I went with the option of having the interface specify a <code>cloneToSolvable</code> method - i.e., the interface specifies a method to clone to the interface type, and implementing classes must have that method in addition to any more specifically typed clone method they might have. This seemed to me the least unpleasant of the options.</p>

6036913,Mini/Junk Dimension Advice,"<p>I have a Client Dimension and a Fact table which tracks Sessions with Clients, these have the following columns:</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>[DimClient]
----------
PK_ClientKey
ClientNumber
EmailAddress
Postcode
PostcodeLongitude
PostcodeLatitude
DateOfBirth
Gender *
Sexuality *
CulturalIdentity *
LanguageSpokenAtHome *
CountryOfBirth
UsualAccommodation *

OccupationStatus *
HighestLevelOfSchooling *
RegistrationDate
LastLoginDate
Status

[FactSession]
-------------
PK_SessionKey
FK_ClientKey
...
</code></pre>

<p>My first requirement was to start grouping the age of the Clients at a specific Session (FactSession), the best way to approach this was to create a Age Group dimension and create a foreign key (FK_AgeGroupKey) in the FactSession to the DimAgeGroup dimension.</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking it would be good to track all the columns with an * (above). These could (not yet proven) have a high correlation against Sessions. Reading through the DWH Toolkit it seems a Mini Dimension to accomodate all the * columns along with the Age Group would suit best, so I put together the following structure:</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>[DimClient]
----------
PK_ClientKey
ClientNumber
...
Status

[DimDemographic]
-----------------
PK_DemographicKey
AgeGroup
Gender
Sexuality
...
HighestLevelOfSchooling

[FactSession]
-------------
PK_SessionKey
FK_ClientKey
FK_DemographicKey
</code></pre>

<p>The DimDemographic table would need to utilize a SCD Type 2 to be able to track the changes over time. Would this be the best approach to my requirements?</p>

<p>Additionally, I have RegistrationDate and LastLoginDate columns on my Client Dimension, in the case where a Client registers but never logs in what would be the best value to put in the LastLoginDate field? Something like '1900-01-01' or NULL?</p>

<p>One of the problems I had in the application, was that when you uploaded images to it, I had the images created, (as say an NSImage object) and then I just had them sitting in memory, the more I uploaded the more memory they took up, and I ended up running out of memory. </p>

<p>My question is this: if I am going to have users upload images to this application in cocoa, how should I go about storing them? I don't just want to copy the file paths, because I want what is saved to contain the images, etc. Is there any way to upload an image and copy it into a different place only for my application? Then load that image with the new path name as needed? </p>

<p>Only I would like it all to be consolidated. I'm going to implement saving by archiving one ""master"" object into an NSData*- so I'd like the images to be saved with that. </p>

<p>Is there a temporary location maybe where I could write the images to disk for my application, and then when I saved, they would all be archived into a single file? Also, how do I do this? Thanks.</p>

<p>His solution works perfectly when using open type fonts as most of them have a minus character that can be easily accessed: </p>

<p>However, my attempts to do something similar with <code>pdfLaTeX</code> and Libertine or Pagella have been futile. Using a symbol like hyphen (<code>\textendash</code>) works perfectly:</p>

<pre><code>\def\yyy{%

<p>The Idea is that there is a web server, which is common for all the Client-C# Applications and for the Web-Users.
The C# Application is communicating with the webserver (HTTP because of firewalls) and the Web-Users have to be able to use the C# Application trough that Web Interface.</p>

<p>The Idea is that the C# Applications are sending their POST/GET data eg 10 times a second and the answer from the webserver is containing the user input.</p>

And I also now have no idea on how to get the single frames ,which are sended from c#, to a fluent stream for the user.</p>

6036936,Could I put a condition to filter my COUNT clause? mysql,"<p>I will solely explain what's related to the question and omit any other unrelated details.</p>

<p><strong>Current Situation:</strong> </p>

<p>I have two tables, coin and users. </p>

<p><strong><code>coin</code></strong> has three fields <code>id, uid, fid.</code> 
Coin table relates between users (who already registered in the system and are able to invite friends) and their friends (who already has accepted the invitation and also became members.) -the table only stores successful registrations after being invited-  </p>

<p><strong><code>id</code></strong> is unique index.<br>
<strong><code>uid</code></strong> is to store users id.<br>
<strong><code>fid</code></strong> is to store friends id (the friend who accepted the invitation and became a member of the system). </p>

<p><strong><code>users</code></strong> has the usual info about users such as <code>id, fname, lname, email</code> ...etc and <code>date_create</code></p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> 
To find the <strong>winners</strong> who had made most invitations. In other words. 
To find top user(s) who have made the greatest number of invitation and their invited friends must have registered before 2012-08-31. Date is stored in table 'users' column date_create. Date Format is yyyy-mm-dd</p>

<p>Example- </p>

<pre><code>Table coin

    id uid fid 
    1  333 777   
    2  444 888       
    3  555 999       
    4  333 123         
    5  444 456         
    6  333 789   

Table users
    id   date_create
    333  2012-07-15
    444  2012-07-20
    555  2012-07-25

    456  2012-07-25
    789  2012-07-25
</code></pre>

<p>means user 333 has the most number of invitation (invited 3 users) -> 777,123 and 789

6036951,Software Proxy & LB options. Must be layer 3 and redundant,"<p>Currently we have good ol' LVS running in the same subnet as our webservers. We use Piranha for automatic redundancy and take full advantage of the status check scripts to not only automatically detect when a server is down, but to curl a control page we have written so we can take servers off the cluster (and put them back on!) at our leisure. It's a neat and useful solution. We load balance http and https with no issue.</p>

<p>We are in the process of tightening up security and are going to put in proxies on a different subnet to forward to the web servers. Ideally we would like to proxy and load balance on the same box (cluster).</p>

<p>So essentially my requirements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Must be able to reverse proxy</li>
<li>Must be able to load balance (across subnets, so LVS is out).</li>
<li>Must be able to modify the http headers so we can determine true client IP (X-Forwarded-For is okay but we'd prefer to add a custom tag, only Apache can do this that I've seen so far).</li>
<li>Must have automatic redundancy with automatic failover</li>
<li>Must support https (ideally all the way to the back end)</li>
<li>Ideally have the ability to run a status check (send/expect) script to determine if the host is up or down.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've found 1 solution that could involve Pound and Stunnel but I can't find a clear answer on whether Pound works in layer 3. How do you make Pound redundant?</p>

<p>The same for HAProxy, how do you make that redundant? I know there's a httpcheck module for that so that's good. Can you modify headers with HAProxy (other than X-Forwarded-For)?</p>

<p>So far all I can come up with is sticking our existing LVS cluster in front of a bunch of Apache servers run mod_proxy and mod_http and have a 1 to 1 mapping of proxy to web server.
I'm all ears to other solutions though!</p>

<p>EDIT: I can't work out if HAProxy supports https without Stunnel now. If it does can it forward decrypt the https then send a https request to the back end or does it decrypt and forward off http?</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>If I change the parameter to RelayCommand<code>&lt;string</code>> instead of RelayCommand<code>&lt;MessageTokens</code>> the code runs fine.</p>

<p>I'm loathe to do this since I lose all the benefits of strongly typing my parameters.</p>

<p>I suspect that I am not declaring the enum properly in XAML. I've tried </p>

<pre><code>  CommandParameter = ""&lt;fullpath&gt;..MessageTokens.SupplierInvoice&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>but that gives an InvalidCastException in MVVMLight.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>Many thanks

<p>The issue was because I wasn't properly referring to the inner class in the CommandParameter binding with the + sign.</p>

<p>the correct XAML should be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Controls1:RadMenuItem Command=""{Binding SalesInvoiceViewModel.OpenInvoiceWindowCommand}"" CommandParameter=""{x:Static local:DebitInvoiceViewModelBase+MessageTokens.SalesInvoice}"" Header=""Raise a sales invoice""/&gt;

You have to build Inkscape with

6036959,Best way to handle URL redirects without having lots of errors appear in my apache error_log?,"<p>My website has hundreds of thousands of photos, and due to costs I've recently moved half of them to a cheaper host.  I can split them into frequently-accessed and infrequently-accessed, and it works out cheapest to keep the frequent ones at my main webhost, and the less frequent ones (lower bandwidth) on Rackspace Cloudfiles.</p>

<p>Anyway, after moving 100,000 files across, I set up a database table with all of the ""before"" and ""after"" URLs in it, as I knew search engines would be trying to come in on the old links.</p>

<p>Now if a search engine etc requests a file on the old URL, it gets bounced to my 404 page, which then does a lookup in the database to find the new URL, where possible.  I then serve it up with a 301 header, so hopefully they'll get the message in the end and stop looking in the wrong place.</p>

<p>The problem is, all of these then get logged as ""file does not exist"" in my error_log.  Which annoys the OCD in me, and makes it harder to spot genuine errors.</p>

<p>I can understand why they end up there, what would you suggest I do to better solve this problem?</p>

<p>I'd prefer not to compromise the performance of the images that DO exist on my server.  So I don't want to mod_rewrite the entire images folder to be passed to a php script, as for most requests it's an unnecessary step.</p>

6036962,Where to store the complete url in a cms?,"<p>I'm creating a cms and have not yet settled on the matter of where to store the complete url for a given page in the structure.</p>

<p>Every page have a slug (url friendly name of the page) and every page has a nullable (for top-level pages) parent and children.</p>

<p>Where do I store the complete url (/first-page/sub-page) for a given page? Should this go in the database along with the other properties of the page or in some cache?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>It's not the database design I'm asking about, rather where to store the complete url to a given page so I don't need to traverse the entire url to get the page that the user requested (/first-page/sub-page)</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>I need to find which page belongs to the currently requested url. If the requested url is /first-page/sub-page I don't want to split the url and looping through the database (obviously).</p>

<p>I'd rather have the entire url in the table so that I can just do a single query (WHERE url = '/first-page/sub-page') but this does not seem ideal, what if I change the slug for the parent page? Then I also need to update the url-field for all descendants.</p>

<p>How do other people solve this issue? Are they putting it in the database? In a cache that maps /first-page-/sub-page to the id for the page? Or are they splitting the requested url and looping though the database?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

I want to update a rectangular area on a form or frame with the TBitmaps I create from the camera's JPEG frames that are received at a rate of 25 frames per second.  </p>

<p>I want to know what method will give me the best performance and what Windows API calls or Delphi calls to use to do it.  I would guess I should not use a TImage or TPicture or similar VCL component because they run on the main thread and I'm pretty sure trying to get anything done via a Synchronize() call is going to be inefficient and has the potential to slow down the threads involved.  I would also want a technique that provides a smooth video display like double buffered controls do without any ""striping"" effects. Also, any tips on proper Canvas locking or device context management, etc. would be appreciated, especially tips on avoiding common mistakes in freeing resources.</p>

6036973,Objective C shared readonly instance of class,"<p>I want to make a readonly instance of a class in Objective C. I have a vector class which is basically floats for x and y position and some methods. In a lot of cases I need a (0, 0)-vector so I was thinking instead of allocating a new one each time that I would have a shared zero vector, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Don't want to do this all the time (allocate new vector)
compare(v, [[Vector alloc] initWithCartesian:0:0]);

// Want to do this instead (use a shared vector, only allocate once)
compare(v, [Vector zeroVector]);

// My attempt so far
+ (Vector *)zeroVector {
    static Vector *sharedZeroVector = nil;
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&amp;onceToken, ^{

    });
    return sharedZeroVector;
}

// The problem
v.x = 3;

<p>This works fine, except that the zero vector is not readonly, which feels kind of silly. As a note I would like to mention that this is more of a want-to-know-how-to kind of question than an actual problem, I don't know if it will make some actual difference.</p>

6036980,How to approach caching in ZF2,"<p>I am just starting to get my head into caching as a whole. I have a simple indexAction() that fetches all given Datasets. My approach is:</p>

<ul>
<li>check for existing key 'controllername-index-index'</li>
<li>if existing: return the value of the key</li>
<li>if <strong>not</strong> existing, do the normal action and add the key</li>
</ul>

<p>The value inside the key should be the ViewModel that will be generated and populated with my data. </p>

<p>Here's what i have done so far:</p>

<pre><code>public function indexAction()
{
    $sl = $this-&gt;getServiceLocator();
//  $cache = $sl-&gt;get('cache');
//  $key = 'kennzahlen-index-index';
//
//  if ($cache-&gt;hasItem($key)) {
//      return $cache-&gt;getItem($key);
//  }

    $viewModel = new ViewModel();
    $viewModel-&gt;setTemplate('kennzahlen/index/index');
    $entityService = $sl-&gt;get('kennzahlen_referenzwert_service');
    $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('entities', $entityService-&gt;findAll());

//  $cache-&gt;setItem($key, $viewModel);

    return $viewModel;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Caching parts are commented out for testing purposes, but basically this is all that i am doing. The Caching config/service looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>'cache' =&gt; function () {
    return \Zend\Cache\StorageFactory::factory(array(
        'adapter' =&gt; array(
            'name' =&gt; 'filesystem',
            'options' =&gt; array(
                'cache_dir' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../../data/cache',
                'ttl' =&gt; 100
            ),
        ),
        'plugins' =&gt; array(
            array(
                'name' =&gt; 'serializer',
                'options' =&gt; array(

                )
            )
        )
    ));
},
</code></pre>

<p>The serialization and caching works quite well, but i am surprised by the missing results. Going by what the ZendDevelopersToolbar tells me, the times WITHOUT caching range between 1.8s to 2.5s. Having the caching parts uncommented (enabled) doesn't really improve the loading time of my page at all.</p>

<p>So my question is: Is this approach completely wrong? Are there different, more speedy parts, that can be saved with some neat configuration tricks?</p>

<p>I Feel that a 2 second load time of a page is DEFINITELY too slow. 1s to me is the maximum given a huge amount of data, but certainly not anything more than that :S</p>

<p>All help/hints/suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

6036988,Most straightforward alternative to a while loop in python,"<p>The general point of the program is to search for words and make sure that they occur in the right order. </p>

<p>I am currently using the code </p>

<pre><code>while not corpus[index_F2-1] == corpus[index_B]:
    index_F2 = corpus.index(corpus[index_F2], index_F2+1) 
</code></pre>

<p>in order to search for a word, check to make sure that a given word appears before it, and find a different instance of the same word in the corpus if the word does not appear in the correct environment. The only problem with this code is that, if the conditions are never met, it returns an error. Rather than having it return an error, it would be better if it could exit the loop, and then assign a new value to ""F2"" in order to try again. The obvious way to make the program exit the loop would be to use a while loop, but I am unsure how to get a while loop to not find a new value for F2 if the current one works. In short, it would work best if the script ran in this order.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check to see if the current F2 will ever work</li>
<li>If it will not work, assign a new value to F2. </li>
<li>Check again recurse and check to see if the new F2 will work</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ol>

<p>An if statement would probably be in order, but exactly where and how it would work, I am unsure. Also, the code for reassigning F2 already exists. It is</p>

<pre><code>index_E2= corpus.index(corpus[index_E2], index_E2+1)

index_F = index_E2+1

index_F2 = corpus.index(corpus[index_F], index_F+1)
</code></pre>

<p>A future problem that could present itself is that the corpus may run out of F2 values ( as a result of running out of E2 values) and display a similar error, but that is another issue. </p>

6036989,c# - error compiling targeting Compact Net Framework 3.5 - No overload for method 'GetString' takes '1' arguments,"<p>I actually have two questions regarding the same problem but I think it is better to separate them since I don't think they are related.</p>

<p>Background: 
I am writing a Windows Mobile software in VB.NET which among its tasks needs to connect to a mail-server for sending and retrieving e-mails. As a result, I also need a Mime-parser (for decoding and encoding) the e-mails in order to get the attachments. First I thought, I would write a small ""hack"" to handle this issue (using ordinary string-parsing) but then I saw a project, written in C#, <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/MIME_De_Encode_in_C_.aspx?fid=209566&amp;df=90&amp;mpp=25&amp;noise=3&amp;sort=Position&amp;view=Quick&amp;select=1202157"" rel=""nofollow"">at CodeProject</a> which I thought I would implement into my solution. I don't know much about C# so I simply made a class-library out of the classes and used it in my VB.NET-project. This library works very nicely when I am targeting the Net Framework on normal windows-computers however when I was going to make the same library targeting the Compact Net Framework, I ran into troubles. This is natural since the Compact Net Framework has more limits but I actually didn't get that many errors - only two although repeated in various places in the code.</p>

<p>One of the errors is the one cited in the subject of this question i.e. ""No overload for method 'GetString' takes '1' arguments"". As mentioned above, I don't know much about C# so I converted the class with the error online into VB-NET but still I don't understand much.. Here is the function which gives above indicated error:</p>

<pre><code>public virtual string DecodeToString(string s)
{
  byte[] b = DecodeToBytes(s);
  if(m_charset != null)
  {
    //ERROR ON THIS LINE
    return System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(m_charset).GetString(b);
  }
  else
  {
    m_charset = System.Text.Encoding.Default.BodyName;
    //ERROR ON THIS LINE
    return System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetString(b);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the complete source-code is needed for this class, then I can post it in another message in this thread or you can find it by downloading the code at the web-site mentioned above and by having a look at the class named MimeCode.cs.</p>

<p>Anyone who can help me out? Can I rewrite above function somehow to overcome this problem?</p>

<p>I thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<p>Kind regards and a Happy New Year to all of you.</p>

6036991,How to check if different values are not in an array using JQuery inArray?,"<p>I have written some code that checks if an array exists and if not, creates one called window.list</p>

<p>It then checks if the array contains a 2 or a 3 value and if not adds them to the list.</p>

<p>if they are within the list already it outputs ""Value is already in the list!"" then breaks out of the function.</p>

<p>When I execute the code it only recognises the first clause of inArray that checks for  a 2 value.
3 does not function. I would like the ability to add more values in the future. I'm not sure this is the most efficient way to write this query.</p>

<pre><code>if (typeof window.list == ""undefined"" || !(window.list instanceof Array)) {
    window.list = new Array;
}

if ($.inArray(2, window.list) == -1 || $.inArray(3, window.list) == -1) {
    window.list.push(presentationId);
} else {
    console.log(""Value is already in the list!"")

"
6036992,Dealing with massive number of Rules (conditions and constraints) CEP systems,"<p>I'm working on an application that accepts 100k+ unique inputs - for simplicity lets assume each input is a floating point value(a,b,c...etc) - though they could also be strings etc. The application has many rules/events/triggers that are related to these inputs.</p>

<p><strong>Example1:</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>Rule[(a &gt; b) and (c &lt;= d)] --&gt; [execute EventX]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Definition1:</strong> The above rule says: when the value of input 'a' is greater than that of 'b' and the value of input 'c' is less than or equal to that of 'd' execute EventX </p>

<p><strong>Example2:</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>Rule[x != x.prev] --&gt; [execute EventZ]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Definition2:</strong> The above rule says: If after a value update, if the current value of input 'x' is not equal to its previous value (the value has changed). execute EventZ</p>

<p>What I'm finding is that as the number of inputs increases, and as the number of rules increase, the total amount of computation required to evaluate the 'specific' rules and determine if an event should be triggered is getting out of control - Throwing faster and more h/w at the problem isn't scaling as expected.</p>

<p>At the moment, upon every new input update, the associated input/variable is looked-up in a hash-table that maps the variable to rules that contain it. Each of those rules are then subsequently evaluated, and if the result is true or actionable, the relevant event is triggered asynchronously.</p>

<p>This problem is in the realm of Complex Event Processing, unfortunately most of the architectures in this realm use the same deadhead approach described above - perhaps with a few refinements relating to the frequency with which things are evaluated/reevaluated. The idea is to have a system that can react in near real-time. Distributing the rules and inputs over multiple nodes doesn't seem to work well either, as in some situations a minority of inputs exists in over 95% of the active rules.</p>

<p>I was hoping if there are any fellow SO'ers out there, that know of better methods to solve this problem, data/structures or algorithms.</p>

<p>A simple idea I have in mind is that one could construct a list of dependent logical inferences. </p>

<p>If there are two rules that are like so:</p>

<pre><code>Rule[a &lt; b] --&gt; [exec E1]
Rule[b &gt;= a] --&gt; [exec E2]
</code></pre>

<p>Then an update on either 'a' or 'b' should not require the evaluation of both etc. but I find that building such logical inference structures to be highly complex and error prone, and difficult to completely and rigorously test.</p>

<p>Inputs could be representative of things such as stock prices, temperature sensors etc.</p>

<p>One further note, some of the inputs are temporally constrained, meaning that the rule may require the state of a variable to be in a specific position/state for some amount of time (eg: the price of MSFT > $20 for last 30sec), currently this is accomplished by using a 'representing variable' (facade) that has a value of either 0 or 1 /false or true (the value of the variable is determined by a separate mechanism, that is usually the result of a rule being triggered).</p>

<p>Also it should be noted that due to the near real-time constraints and the amount of data being produced per second, options using a DB with triggers and stored procedures are out of the question.</p>

6036999,ArrayAdapter and android:textFilterEnabled,"<p>I have created a layout which includes a ListView.</p>

<p>The data shown within this ListView isn't too complicated, it's mostly an Array which is passed when the extended Activity is started.</p>

<p>The rows themselves exist out of an icon and a text, thus an ImageView and a TextView.
To fill up the ListView I use an ArrayAdapter simply because an Array is passed containing all the text-items that should be shown.</p>

<p>Now I'd like to actually be able to filter those, thus I found the android:textFilterEnabled paramater to add on the ListView xml declaration...
Now a search field is shown nicely but when I enter some letters it won't filter but it will simply delete the whole list.
I found out that that's because the textfilter has no idea what it should filter.</p>

<p>So now my question is : I know I need to tell the textfilter what it should filter, I also still have my array filled with the text that should get filtered so how do i couple those two?</p>

<p>I have seen examples extending a CursorAdapter, but again, I don't have a Cursor, I don't want to do calls to a DB I want to re-utilize my Array with data and obviously the ArrayAdapter itself so that the data will be represented decently on screen (i.e with my ImageView and TextView layout).</p>

<p>How can this be done?</p>

<p>At this moment this works quite well, Urls are mapped and shown in the navigation frame D. However when a user is not authenticated and browses to a page, the login view should be displayed in stead of the grid with the 4 cells.

6037013,Replicating WPF TabControl selected TabItem design time behavior for a custom control,"<p>I'm developing a custom control which shows an inline popup window and I would like to use a similar technique as the TabControl employes so that only popup windows that are selected within the designer or more commonly by placing the cursor within the popup declaration in XAML that it is visualized right within the desiger without having to run the application or change any runtime values by hand.</p>

<p>I've started by duplicating the implementation of the TabControl which I have successfully mimicking everything but it is all copied from Reflector output and Stylesnooper. I've renamed all of the control parts and then replaced the default templates so that the main control uses an ItemsPresenter instead of a ContentPresenter to show the individual popup controls within a Grid panel overlayed on top of one another. So far this is working great too. The problem is that somewhere along the line I lost the ability to have the designer follow the item that is selected in the XAML editor.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let me explain this code:<br>
I have three containers: 0,1 and 2. However this is variable. There could be more or less. 
In each container I always have the same number of items, in this case two. This can vary as well but it will always be the same amount across all containers.<br>
The items with the same class are the same items! The only difference is that they are in different containers.<br>
The name and ID for each input item is used in my php script to determine after submitting the form:  </p>

<pre><code>containerItem[1][0]
containerItem[ContainerNumber][Item]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What I want to accomplish:</strong><br>
There is a individual maximum amount for each containerItem.<br>
Let's say containerItem0 = 100, containerItem1 = 200, containerItem2 = 300.<br>
Now when I enter a numeric value into the input field for containerItem0, e.g. 20. It should update a  which could be behind the input field how much is left, in this case 80.<br>
Not only should it update the  behind the input field where I just entered the numeric value but behind all other containerItem0's as well.</p>

<p><strong>What I tried</strong></p>

<pre><code>// php part
// Create variables for use in jquery for the max values for the containerItems
$jqueryVars="""";
$j=0;
// containerItems is an array I get with the numberOrdered value which equals the maximum number allowed
foreach ($containerItems as $key =&gt; $value) {
    $jqueryVars .= ""var maxContainerItem"".$j."" = "".$value['NumberOrdered']."";\n"";
    $j++;
}


// jQuery part:
// Calculate left amount of container items.
'$(document).change(function() {
    '.$jqueryVars.'
    var sumOfValues = 0;
    //I USED &gt;&gt;.containerItem0&lt;&lt; in this case to see if it works, however this should be variable
    $("".containerItem0"").each(function(){
       sumOfValues+=$(this).val();
    });
    alert(sumOfValues);
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see I am stuck making this whole thing dynamic. I partially get the alert message of sumOfValues. Why partially? It does not add the numbers but appends them as they were strings.<br>
Also, I do not know how to iterate through all container classes and listen for changes in the input fields.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to get any pointers into the right direction :)</p>

<p>When I add a VM to our Nagios server I add the machines in our virtualisation cluster as the parents of that machine, because if any one of those servers is up, the VM should be accessible. This results in an entry in the definition of each VM of the form:</p>

6037017,How can I keep track of changes to content? - i.e. revision history,"<p>I searched and found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4929165/track-changes-revisions-script-in-php"">this question</a>. But that question and the solution deal with PHP.</p>

<p>I am developing many applications in ASP.Net MVC 2. Each one has some type of text content that users can post. Example: Website, Blog, Issue Tracking, Comments.</p>

<p>I want to maintain the revision history of each one and show the changes made from one revision to another, when requested. You know.. the deleted content is shown in red with a strike-through and the added content is shown in green etc.. that type of thing.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether you save the changes alone for each revision, or save the whole content and calculate the diff when showing or how it is done.</p>

<p>Is there a .Net library that lets me do this?</p>

6037030,How to tell TeamCity to treat merges as a single commit when working with git?,"<p>We recently moved from SVN to git. We work with a main ""release"" branch (master), and feature branches for every feature a dev is working on. 
In <a href=""http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/"">TeamCity</a> we have a project for every feature branch, and of course a project for the master. </p>

<p>When we worked with SVN, whenever someone merged from master to his feature branch or vice-versa, the merge was treated by TeamCity as one commit. Now, with git, every merge causes TeamCity to show all of the commits that came with this merge.</p>

<p>This causes some problems, for example when someone merge from master to his feature branch, and now his TeamCity project shows ""283 pending changes"" due to that merge, if builds fail, the authors of these changes will be notified, as if they did these changes on the feature branch. </p>

<p>Is there a way to tell TeamCity to treat git merges as single commit?</p>

<p>We could solve it using squashed merges but that's something we would really like to avoid. </p>

"
6037053,Are there any design patterns that could work in this scenario?,"<p>We have a system (Java web application) that's been in active development / maintenance for a long time now (something like ten years).</p>

<p>What we're looking at doing is implementing a RESTful API to the web app. This web application, using Jersey, will be a separate project with the intent that it should be able to run alongside the main application or deployed in the cloud.</p>

<p>Because of the nature and age of our application, we've had to implement a (somewhat) comprehensive caching layer on top of the database (postgres) to help keep load down. Anyway, for the RESTful API, the idea is that GET requests will go to the cache first instead of the database to keep load of the database.</p>

<p>The cache will be populated in a way to help ensure that most things registered API users will need should be in there.</p>

<p>If there is a cache miss, the needed data should be retrieved from the database (also being entered into the cache in the process).</p>

<p>Obviously, this should remain transparent from the RESTful endpoint methods in my code. We've come up with the idea of creating a 'Broker' to handle communications with the DB and the cache. The REST layer will simply pass across ids (if looking to retrieve) or populated Java objects (if looking to insert / update) and the broker will take care of retrieving / updating / invalidating, etc.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of extensibility. To begin with, the API will be living alongside the rest of servers so access to the database won't be an issue however if we deploy to the cloud, we're going to need a different Broker implementation that will communicate with the system (namely the database) in a different manner (potentially through the use of an internal API).</p>

<p>I already have a rough idea on how I can implement this but it struck me that is probably a problem for which a suitable pattern could exist. If I could follow an established pattern as opposed to coming up with my own solution, that'll probably be a better choice. Any ideas?</p>

        $('#groupOverview').fadeIn(400);
    });
});

<p>The above code is used in the same way to hide ""instructions"" and ""group"" divs (and about 7 other divs in the same manner). The similar way that each is called is with this code:</p>

&lt;a id=""hideGroupOverview"" href=""javascript:void(0);""&gt;&lt;img src=""img/misc/plus.png"" alt="""" width=""40"" height=""40"" border=""0""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id=""hideGroupDetail"" href=""javascript:void(0);""&gt;&lt;img src=""img/misc/minus.png"" alt="""" width=""40"" height=""40"" border=""0""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm thinking that there's a way that I can create a function that accepts variables, and that I pass three variables on click: <strong>(1)</strong> what image id was clicked (I think that <code>$this</code> is probably used), <strong>(2)</strong> what div to <code>fadeOut</code> and <strong>(3)</strong> what div to <code>fadeIn</code>. I can't seem to get the variable creation and passing correct, but I imagine that the final, reusable function would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// divToggler
$('$this').click(function() {
    $('#divToFadeOut').fadeOut(400, function () {
        $('#divToFadeIn').fadeIn(400);
    });
});

<p>It's pretty simple - I'm pointing the DNS of a new domain to my current hosting, but when I visit the new domain, I'm just viewing my original site (the one i got with my hosting).</p>

<p>Let's say my original site is ""www.originalsite.com"" - the content for my new domain is at ""www.originalsite.com/newsite.com/"" (dots included).</p>

<p>Now I just need to get ""www.newsite.com"" to re-direct to it's own directory AND re-write itself to hide the directory name.</p>

6037072,Dirac measure and counting measure,"<p>Let $X$ be a nonempty set. I would like hints in showing the following:<br>

(b) Let $x\in X$. Let $\delta_x$ be the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_measure"" rel=""nofollow"">Dirac measure</a> at $x$ on $2^X$. Then two functions on $X$ are equal almost everywhere $[\delta_x]$ if and only if they take the same value at $x$.<br>
(c) Let $\alpha$ be the counting measure on $2^X$. Then two functions on $X$ are equal almost everywhere $[\alpha]$ if and only if they take the same value at every point in $X$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Following Davide's hints,  </p>

<p>(a) Let $\mathcal{B}=2^X$. Then $2^X$ is a sigma algebra and by definition the if $(X,2^X)$ is a measure space, then $f:X\to \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is measurable since the the set $\{x\in X : f(x) &lt; c\} \in 2^X$ for every $c\in \mathbb{R}$.  </p>

<p>(b) Here, it suffices to show that the sets which have measure zero are the sets which does not contain $x$. So suppose $f=g$ a.e. then there is a set $N$ with measure zero such that $A=\{x\in X : f(x)\ne g(x)\} \subset N$. But these are precisely those  points which don't contain $x$. So $f(x)=g(x)$ on $N^c$.  </p>

<p>(c) By definition of the counting measure , the empty set is the only set with counting measure zero. So $f=g$ a.e. $\Leftrightarrow f(x)=g(x)$ at every point in $X$.</p>

6037075,Executing wkhtmltopdf from PHP fails,"<p>There have been a few topics similar to mine, but they did not help me. Maybe something new will come up.</p>

<p>Problem: I can't execute wkhtmltopdf form PHP.
My basic code is: 
<code>exec('wkhtmltopdf http://somesite.com /home/user/file.pdf');</code></p>

<p>Now a few things I already checked:</p>

<ul>
<li>the same command works when executed from console</li>
<li>safe_mode is disabled - I can execute commands in PHP, for example <code>exec('ls');</code> works fine</li>
<li>path to wkhtmltopdf can be found and I can run the program itself, for example <code>exec('wkhtmltopdf -V');</code> works fine and outputs versioning info</li>
<li>the output path is writable, it has 777 permissions and <code>exec('wkhtmltopdf -V &gt; /home/user/file.pdf');</code> works fine, creates the file and puts versioning info inside</li>
<li>executing from PHP has internet access, for exemple <code>exec('wget -O /home/user/file.pdf http://somesite.com')</code> works fine, retrieves the site source and puts it into the file</li>
<li>replacing exec with passthru, shell_exec etc. makes no difference</li>
</ul>

<p>Concluding:
I can execute wkhtmltopdf, I can access internet, I can write the specific file, but a correct conversion command fails and returns status 1.</p>

<p>I use the latest Ubuntu, PHP Version is 5.3.10-1ubuntu3, wkhtmltopdf version is 0.9.9.
I tried it also on some other machine with the same retults.</p>

<p>Any (just ANY) ideas will be greatly appreciated!</p>

6037095,ASP.NET handle a POST from Sage Pay,"<p>I am writing an asp.net web application to talk to sage pay and make payments via their server to server method. At present my site collects user details and then sends a transaction registration HttpRequest to their server. Their server then responds to my request with some details and a redirect link. I check out the reponse object and then redirect to their payment page where the users payment details (card number etc) can be entered. Once the user has clicked confirm then sage will send a POST to a url of my choosing which I can then process and tell them whether to continue with the transaction or not.</p>

<p>What I am aiming to do is receive the POST from them, check the content and respond accordingly. I must then give them as part of my  success or failure url which their site will send the user too on completion of the transaction. If I were sending a request first it would be easy but I am not. They just need an address to send the response to and then I must process it.</p>

<p>My question is this. How can I handle an HttpRequest (I assume this is what it will be?) in my web application? </p>

<p>Can I do this by telling them to respond to a generic handler? If I were to give them the url of my generic handler could I process the POST in there and then respond to them?</p>

<p>I'm following a tutorial right now on making a drop-down menu out of pure CSS. After implementing the first few lines of CSS code I was losing all of my sub menus in the drop-down. After pulling my hair out trying to figure out why for the better part of 2 hours, I finally preview in Firefox.  (can't believe I didn't try earlier.) 
    It all seems to work fine in my browser, but I was wondering: Is there a way I can look at it in Dreamweaver? Its really inconvenient popping in and out of my browser everytime I want to check something.  Like I said, I'm basically (not really basically, I just am) a complete noob at all things web-design. Thank you for your time. </p>

6037100,setuid on svn update wrapper not working?,"<p>I have an svn repository which belongs to user 'foo' and is accessed through Apache, and I'm trying to run svn update from the post-commit hook, on a directory which is also owned by foo.</p>

<p>I created a C wrapper owned by foo and setted the suid bit, as suggested in <a href=""http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#website-auto-update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#website-auto-update</a> , which should then be called by the post-commit script, run by user www-data.</p>

<p>Still, when I run the wrapper from user www-data (with an empty environment) it actually calls svn update as user foo, but inexplicably I get prompted by svn asking for the password of user www-data.</p>

<p>The code for the wrapper, called svnupdater.c is the same (of course with the correct paths) as suggested in the official faqs. It is created and compiled by user foo. After setting the suid bit, ls -l inside /hooks shows among others:</p>

<pre><code>-rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data foo   74 2011-03-28 12:54 post-commit
-rwsr-sr-x 1 foo      foo 7144 2011-03-28 12:16 svnupdater
</code></pre>

<p>If I then 'su www-data' and run 'env - ./svnupdater' (either from sh or from bash), ps aux correctly shows:</p>

<pre><code>foo   20260  3.7  0.8  14008  4492 pts/0    S+   12:18   0:00 svn update /home/foo/foosvn

<p>But still I can see svn update prompting me with:</p>

<pre><code>Authentication realm: &lt;http://xxxxxx&gt; xxxxx
Password for 'www-data':
</code></pre>

<p>And of course the whole thing won't work when the post-commit calls it.</p>

<p>I can't really seem to understand where the problem is, since this strategy is the official suggested one, but it looks like svn update is bypassing the setuid and still using the actual user...</p>
"
6037101,Smallest multiple whose digits are only ones and zeros,"<p>I have a collection of typewritten pages that formed the basis of a third year problem solving course offered about 25 years ago at U. Waterloo. I've been slowly working through the problems and have come up with a solution to one of the questions but was wondering if anyone had a better solution.</p>

<p><strong>The question is:</strong> Find the smallest natural number composed only of ones and zeros which is divisible by 225.</p>

<p><strong>My solution:</strong> We are looking for a positive integer $k$ so that $N=225k$ has only ones and zeroes in the digits.  Since any multiple of 5 has a 0 or 5 for the last digit, then k must be even.  But $2\times 225=450$, so it really means that $k$ must be a multiple of 4.  Now $N=900K$, where $4K=k$.</p>

<p>Let $100K=\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i 10^i$, where (potentially) an infinite number of the $a_i$'s vanish.</p>

<p>The solution method is to look at each term $a_i$ starting with $a_0$ and choose the $a_i$ so that the ones digit of the product $9a_i + c_{i-1}$ is a one or zero, where $c_{i-1}$ is the carry from the previous product.  This forms a tree, starting with $a_0$ at the root.  The smallest $N$ is found from the smallest limb of the tree.</p>

<p>Each of the following congruences are $\mod 10$.</p>

<p>We choose $a_0$ so that $9a_0 \equiv 0$ or $9a_0 \equiv 1$.  Only $a_0=9$ works here, so there is a carry of 8 when considering $a_1$.  Then we have the congruences $9a_1+8\equiv 0$ or $9a_1+8\equiv 1$.  </p>

<p>This gives two options to consider for $a_1$: either $a_1=8$ with a carry of 8 or $a_1=7$ with a carry of 7.  The first just leads to a larger number for $N$, so we ignore it and move on to $a_2$.  This has four options, but the only one we can use that has smallest $N$ is $a_2=6$ with a carry of 6.  </p>

<p>Continuing in this way leads to $K=12345679$ and $k=4\times 12345679 = 49072716$, which means that $N=11111111100$.  This was verified by a simple computer program I wrote that checked all of the smaller multiples.</p>

<p><strong>Question for the group:</strong>  For different numbers from 225, this leads to very dense and deep trees when solving for $a_i$.  In fact, I had a originally solved this question using 255 instead of 225 because I misread it, which had a much denser tree because none of the branches could be eliminated at each step.  Does anyone know of a cleaner/simpler solution?</p>

All of the data in the file is preserved, but the filename appears to not be decoded properly.  Often, the filename ends up so long that it loses the original extension, and the user gets a page filled with garbage if they try to open the attachment in their browser.  This is happening even though the database ""filename"" field displays the original characters correctly.</p>

6037109,Human-readable XML output from Scala?,"<p>Scala seems to do two things to XML that you enter that make it no less parseable but make it less readable:</p>

<p>First, it expands tags that close themselves:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; &lt;tag/&gt;
res109: scala.xml.Elem = &lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And second, it scrambles attributes into random order, as if it put them into a hash set:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; &lt;tag a=""a"" b=""b"" c=""c"" d=""d""/&gt;         
res110: scala.xml.Elem = &lt;tag d=""d"" a=""a"" c=""c"" b=""b""&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Together, these conspire to render XML considerably less human-readable (at least by me).  I'm not very familiar with the XML library; is there a way to perform xml-to-string translation that yields a compact human-readable form?  (If not by default, by recursing and writing one's own string conversions--or are there too many special cases that lurk there?)</p>

6037110,Toggle tooltip text,"<p>Basically my issue is that my tooltip won't change text on toggle. I have a page with expand/collapse functionality. Normally, when you hover over the up arrow, the title tag will say collapse panel. When you click the arrow button to collapse the div panel, the img changes (now the arrow will point down and the title tag should change to expand panel). This works and the title changes WITHOUT tooltips. When tooltips are added, the text doesn't change. I believe you have to destroy and create a new tooltip on click but I'm not sure how to do this.  He's my code, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>So update with the destroy/create method. I can get the tooltip to change to expand on the first click, but it stays as ""expand"". I used this:</p>

    $(document).tooltip(); //here's the change, the tooltip toggles once
    $(""img.toggle1"").attr(""title"", ""Expand this section"");

6037111,W7 routing - traffic not going to default gateway,"<p>I have a really strange Windows 7 IPv4 routing issue that I can't get to the bottom of.</p>

<p>As expected, it is routing via .253, and the 2nd hop is the inside interface of the Juniper NTU.</p>

<p>I've not inspected the traffic yet.  In particular, I was going to look for ICMP redirects, though why there would be an ICMP redirect at all is not really sensible?</p>

<p>.254 <em>used</em> to be the default gateway before the fibre was installed.</p>

<p>Any ideas?  Doesn't make sense to me why there should be this routing issue :(</p>

<p>The Draytek Dual WAN Router was rebooted, the PC was rebooted.  The PC had the network disabled and then re-enabled.  All the standard stuff when Windows looses the plot.</p>

<p>Hopefully somebody recognises the symptoms!</p>

<p>PPS: No iSCSI involved on/at this or any other workstation so <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/375798/windows-7-routing-traffic-through-the-gateway-for-local-addresses"">Windows 7 routing traffic through the gateway for local addresses</a> isn't the issue.</p>

<p>But in this example I have to put the logic in the view because I have to measure the size of each datagrid in my view every time the row count of one of them is changing. The problem is... in my viewmodel I don´t have access to the datagrid, so I can´t measure anything. And in my view I can´t get a response that the row count has changed.</p>

It is a custom datagrid with a customtemplate btw. maybe that is going to help somehow?</p>

<p>It appears that the events are unhooked - as if you were just inserting fresh html (which I guess is what happening). But its also possible my code has a bug in it - so I just wanted to verify this behavior before I continue. </p>

<p>If this is the case - are there any easy ways to rehookup the events to just that portion of HTML, or a different way to move the element without losing the event in the first place.</p>

<p>with $\alpha=D/2+\nu/2$ and $C$ as a normalization constant. </p>

<p>At this point, I know the cross terms of the product $(\Lambda^{-1/2}y+\mu) (\Lambda^{-1/2}y+\mu)^{T}$ vanish and the last term is going to produce $\mu\mu^{T}$ because the distribution is normalized, but I'm having a hard time getting the first term</p>

"
6037124,ASP.NET MVC And LINQ General Questions,"<p>I've asked a few questions on this topic before.  Before we're able to implement either MVC or LINQ at work we need to resolve a few issues.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Record Sets in ASP.NET MVC</strong></p>

<p>The only examples of MVC in use only have a single result set returned.  When using stored procedures multiple record sets can be retrieved, and the whole reason we tend to use stored procedures is for two reasons (which I'm sure many of you are also aware of).  Firstly in case we need to pass parameters, and secondly if we want multiple tables of data returned.  How is this possible in ASP.NET's MVC architecture?</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc/tutorial-11-vb.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a> we see how the data is retrieved.  But it uses <code>ViewData.Model</code> which indicates a single result set, it doesn't explain what happens if multiple result sets are returned, or how to get them.</p>

<p><strong>Strongly Typed Stored Procedure Output</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, the examples on the ASP.NET website for using LINQ for strongly typed resolution of output are achieved by using the *.dbml format which is a mirror image of the table schema allowing for the lookup against fields using LINQ.  Great.  But what happens if your output is custom from a stored procedure which does not map directly to either a view or a table? How do we resolve column names from these stored procedures? </p>

<p>In the previous section I described <a href=""http://www.asp.net/learn/mvc/tutorial-11-vb.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this tutorial</a>, but this also only shows how to create LINQ to SQL for tables only, not the custom output from a sproc. </p>

<p><strong>LINQ Column Lookups</strong></p>

<p>At work we run a macro which exports a bunch of classes to our App_Code folder so stored procedure parameters are pre-defined.  This is done so we don't have to call DeriveParameters which consists of an extra call to the database.  We don't want this to happen because there's a lot of traffic as it is.  If we're using LINQ, how are column data types resolved? Is there a call to the database everytime we define a parameter to find out the data type and name of the parameter?  Have things changed since? Does it still call DeriveParameters every time? Are these cached somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>DBML Formats</strong></p>

<p>Should *.dbml files incorporate all tables from a database?  We have about 15 databases with many, many tables in each one.</p>

<p><strong>A View For Every Output</strong></p>

<p>Yet another point to add to this post.  Instead of manually creating the dbml classes is it better to represent the data as a view, even if it's custom output? Or is it better to create a custom class in the dbml file?</p>

<p><strong>This Must Be The Last Problem Or I Will Eat My Own Arm</strong></p>

<p><em>""Unable to cast object of type 'SingleResult`1[IntranetMVC.UserDetail]' to type 'IntranetMVC.UserDetail'.""</em></p>

<p>Here's the function:</p>

<pre><code>  Function Index() As ActionResult
    ViewData(""Message"") = ""Welcome to ASP.NET MVC!""

    Dim userDetail As UserDetail
    Dim office As IList(Of Office)
    Dim activeUser As IList(Of ActiveUser)
    Dim dept As IList(Of Department)

    Using db As PersonnelDataContext = New PersonnelDataContext
      Dim results As IMultipleResults = db.UserDetail(1168)

      userDetail = results.GetResult(Of UserDetail)()
      office = results.GetResult(Of Office)()
      activeUser = results.GetResult(Of ActiveUser)()
      dept = results.GetResult(Of Department)()
    End Using

    Return View(New IndexViewData(userDetail, office, activeUser, dept))
  End Function
</code></pre>

<p>It's occurring on all of the <code>userDetail, office, activeUser</code> and <code>dept</code> assignments, but I have no idea why.  Now, I haven't mapped them properly yet, but take for example the Department one.  I've dragged and dropped the table schema onto the dbml file, so it definitely exists and is in the right format.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Here's my actual code.  It's not final, I've been playing around with it.  It seems the return types aren't right, but I'm not sure why.  It seems to think only a single result is ever returned when the stored procedure actually returns four sets of data.  One of those sets only ever has a single result, the others always have multiple rows returned:</p>

<p><em>Unable to cast object of type 'SingleResult<code>1[IntranetMVC.Office]' to type 'System.Collections.Generic.IList</code>1</em></p>

<pre><code>Imports System.Data.Linq
Imports System.Reflection
Imports System.Data.Linq.Mapping

Partial Class PersonnelDataContext

  &lt;FunctionAttribute(Name:=""dbo.UserDetailProc""), _
  ResultType(GetType(UserDetail)), _
  ResultType(GetType(IList(Of Office))), _

                  &lt;Parameter(Name:=""EditYN"", DbType:=""Char"")&gt; Optional ByVal EditYN As Char = ""N"") As IMultipleResults

    Dim result As IExecuteResult = Me.ExecuteMethodCall(Me, CType(MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod(), MethodInfo), User_Key, EditYN)
    Return CType(result.ReturnValue, IMultipleResults)
  End Function
End Class
</code></pre>

<p><strong>FIX</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I didn't realise because to be honest with you I wasn't checking the return types correctly.  I <em>assumed</em> that results.GetResult(Of MyType) (from IMultipleResults) would return a collection.  On the contrary, it only returns single results and moves the pointer to the next item in the collection.  Unfortunately GetResult is the only exposed method for bringing back results, so you have to iterate over the collection and add them to a generic list.</p>

<p>Thanks very much!</p>

<p>Would just instantiate the object but I want it too start my out of process COM server as well. Am I missing something here, just wondering if anyone has advice on what to do or where to look.</p>

"
6037130,Need help with credit expiration algorithm,"<p>So I'm stuck. I am working on a credit system with expirations. Similar to credit card miles but not exactly. By the way I am sorry for the book ahead but I needed to add enough detail to help get the whole picture.</p>

<p>What I need is a system where a user accumulates credits for doing activities. But they can also spend these credits on activities. The credits should expire after 30 days if they are not used. I seem to be stuck on how to accurately calculate this in a batch that will run every night. Any ideas in any language would be greatly appreciated as I seem to be stuck on just one minor detail that I can't get around. Here is an example of the data:</p>

<p>7/1: +5 - user signs up<br>
7/2: +5 - user interacts with system<br>
7/2: -3 - user purchases activity<br>
7/3: +5 - user interacts with system<br></p>

<p>So at this point the user has received 15 credits and has spent 3. Leaving him with a total of 12 credits. (At least I got basic math down :P)</p>

<p>I should add that currently we are playing with the idea of having two fields: last processed, next processed. So these values at this time assuming it was a new sign up are:</p>

<p>Last Processed Date: 7/1<br>
Next Process Date:   8/1</p>

<p>So now 8/1 comes around. The batch starts and looks at all credits that are older than 30 days. Which at this point is 5.</p>

<p>This is where it starts to get fuzzy.</p>

<p>Then the system should look at all the credits that have been spent in the last 30 days to see if they are using any credits. Because they should only expire if they haven't been used. So there are 3. So I then deduct the user 2 credits because that is the difference of credits earned older than 30 days and what has been spent. So I finish the batch and set the dates accordingly for the next day. Now assuming they haven't spent anymore I start the calculation over of credits earned older than 30, which is 5 and credits spent which again is 3. But I obviously don't want to consider the 3 credits that I considered yesterday. What is a good approach to not include those 3 credits again for consideration.</p>

<p>That is where I am stuck.</p>

<p>We are thinking about writing a debit record for the expired credits so we can track them but having a hard time seeing how I can use it in this calculation.</p>

<p>If you read this far thank you. If you even make a somewhat effort in the answer I will at a minimum give you an up vote for effort.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
Ok @Greg mentioned something that I forgot to address. The idea of putting a flag on the credits considered. A valid point but not one that can work because of the following scenario:</p>

<p>Let's say that on a particular day a user spends 10 credits. But the expired credits that the batch is considering only accumulated to 5. Well he should still have 5 more credits left over to not have expired because he spent more than a single expiration. So the flag wouldn't work because we would have skipped those 5 extra credits. Hope that makes sense?</p>

6037134,Can the order of 2 mod p be arbitrarily small (relative to $p - 1$)?,"<p>Given a prime number $p$, let $\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ be the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_order"">multiplicative order of $2$ modulo $p$</a>, i.e., the smallest integer $k$ such that $p$ divides $2^k - 1$. By <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_%28group_theory%29"">Lagrange's theorem</a>, $\operatorname{ord}_p(2)$ divides $(p - 1)$, so let $r = r_p(2) = \dfrac{p-1}{\operatorname{ord}_p(2)}$. Question: can $r$ be arbitrarily large? That is, given any $M$, does there always exist some $p$ such that $r_p(2) &gt; M$? </p>

<p>(Note that when $2$ is a primitive root modulo $p$, we have $r_p(2) = 1$, so what we're asking for is primes for which $2$ is arbitrarily ""far"" from being a primitive root.)</p>

<p>One way this would be true is if there are infinitely many <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime"">Mersenne primes</a>. If $p$ is a Mersenne prime, say $p = 2^q - 1$ for some $q$, then $p$ divides (is equal to) $2^q - 1$, and smaller powers of $2$ are less than $p$, so $\operatorname{ord}_p(2) = q$, and $r_p(2) = \dfrac{p-1}{q} = \dfrac{2^q - 1}{q}$ which can be arbitrarily large if there are infinitely many such $q$.</p>

<p>But of course maybe the answer is yes without assuming the existence of infinitely many Mersenne primes. Is it? Is something known about this problem? (Is $2$ special at all?)</p>

<p>I've searched Google but can't seem to find all the answers i'm looking for. It feel like Flex is not that used. </p>

<p>I find that the biggest disadvantage in using flex is that you cannot access the full power of native libraries such as Android SDK etc.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:
1. Are there any other important disadvantages that i need to be aware of?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are there any limitations? For now, i know that apps built with flex need to run on Android 2.2 or higher. Is there an upper limit? </p></li>
<li><p>Does the mobile phone user need to have any other 3rd party installed, such as Adobe AIR in order to use the app ?</p></li>
<li><p>Do most of the devices support Flex built apps? </p></li>

6037145,GHC Install Without Root,"<p>So I'd like to set up a linux machine for Haskell development with one huge caveat -- no root privs on this machine. We could of course get the admins to install GHC for us, eventually. However, in the long-term then we need to hassle them when we want to upgrade, etc. So much better to do everything in userland. Which also means that we'll want to install c libs we link to in userland as well, etc. to keep everything as hassle-free as possible.</p>

<p>So, the question is, how, soup-to-nuts, would I go about doing a purely userland install of GHC? The machine will have gcc, and the usual toolchain. If necessary, we can start with a typical ghc install to get the ball rolling, but it would be nice not to.</p>

6037147,Width and height is 0 for images in a Picture Library Slideshow Web Part after export/import of site collection,"<p>I recently exported/imported an SP2010 site collection from Dev to Prod. The site collection had about 90 sites, which were all driven from a site template. Once the export/import had taken place, I created an additional 15 sites (in Prod), using the original site template that was created in the Dev environment. Everything seemed to be working just fine, but I found an issue with the Picture Library Slideshow Web Parts (PLSWP) on all the sites that were created in Prod. Basically, I have a Picture Library, and any pictures added to this library show up in the PLSWP. The original 80 site's PLSWP works fine, but the new 15 sites will not show the pictures through the PLSWP (the viewer just shows up blank). Here is the difference in the html output of the picture viewer:</p>

<p>You can notice from the above markup, that the PLSWP html from Prod is not correct. The src attribute on the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is <code>/_layouts/images/icjpg.gif</code> and the width and height attributes are <code>0</code>. I have no idea why this is happening. I thought about using JQuery on the fly when the page loads to replace the src attribute with the href attribute of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag - but, I would like to stay away from this.</p>

<p>I know that the PLSWP is what is causing the problem, because I have tried pointing it to a different picture library - no luck. Also, I have tried deleting the PLSWP and re-adding a new one, but I have the same problem.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas on why this is?</p>

<p>This is tricky to explain...</p>

<p>I'm using a generic class name to initiate a plugin feature on an associated element. 
I also want to have options associated with the element stored in an attribute as well.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""url.com"" class=""popup"" rel=""900x900"" &gt;My Link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this, jQuery will look for all elements that have 'popup' and parse the rel value for the dimensions of the popup and initiate the popup() function whenever this link is clicked with a window the size w=900 h=900</p>

<p>but I need to take this a step further because I want to have more options...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""url.com"" class=""popup"" rel=""900x900_scroll_tool_menu"" &gt;My Link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if using the rel attribute is the place for this because I also want to use this on other elements that dont have a rel= attribute.</p>

<p>So I was thinking using classes for this too... I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;a href=""url.com"" class=""popup opt_dim-900x900_scroll_tool_menu"" &gt;My Link&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;img src=""pic.gif"" class=""popup opt_dim-150x200_location"" &gt;My Link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>From the looks of this the <strong>options can get VERY long</strong>, using class seems ok, but maybe there's something better..</p>

<p>Which way do you think is better? Do you have another idea for this? I want to store the options in some html attribute.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I am continually reminded that there are a dozen ways to do anything in Javascript, in terms of the solutions here I later changed the correct answer to the html5 data attribute, which now that ie6 isnt an issue, seems like the best method. </p>

<p>Best, because it uses standard features and avoids any of the hackery I was trying to do with class names. Sure classnames are extremely flexible still, but that solution isn't semantic, nor does it follow best practice of separating views from behavior.</p>

6037153,Creating dynamically sized objects,"<p><strong>Removed the C tag, seeing as that was causing some confusion (it shouldn't have been there to begin with; sorry for any inconvenience there. C answer as still welcome though :)</strong></p>

<p>In a few things I've done, I've found the need to create objects that have a dynamic size and a static size, where the static part is your basic object members, the dynamic part is however an array/buffer appended directly onto the class, keeping the memory contiguous, thus decreasing the amount of needed allocations (these are non-reallocatable objects), and decreasing fragmentation (though as a down side, it may be harder to find a block of a big enough size, however that is a lot more rare - if it should even occur at all - than heap fragmenting. This is also helpful on embedded devices where memory is at a premium(however I don't do anything for embedded devices currently), and things like std::string need to be avoided, or can't be used like in the case of trivial unions.</p>

<p>Generally the way I'd go about this would be to (ab)use malloc(std::string is not used on purpose, and for various reasons): </p>

<pre><code>struct TextCache
{
    uint_32 fFlags;
    uint_16 nXpos;
    uint_16 nYpos;
     TextCache* pNext;
    char pBuffer[0];
};

TextCache* pCache = (TextCache*)malloc(sizeof(TextCache) + (sizeof(char) * nLength));
</code></pre>

<p>This however doesn't sit too well with me, as firstly I would like to do this using new, and thus in a C++ environment, and secondly, it looks horrible :P</p>

<p>So next step was a templated C++ varient:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;const size_t nSize&gt; struct TextCache
{
    uint_32 fFlags;
    uint_16 nXpos;
    uint_16 nYpos;
     TextCache&lt;nSize&gt;* pNext;
    char pBuffer[nSize];
};
</code></pre>

<p>This however has the problem that storing a pointer to a variable sized object becomes 'impossible', so then the next work around:</p>

<pre><code>class DynamicObject {};
template &lt;const size_t nSize&gt; struct TextCache : DynamicObject {...};
</code></pre>

<p>This however still requires casting, and having pointers to DynamicObject all over the place becomes ambiguous when more that one dynamically sized object derives from it (it also looks horrible and can suffer from a bug that forces empty classes to still have a size, although that's probably an archaic, extinct bug...).</p>

<p>Then there was this:</p>

<pre><code>class DynamicObject
{
    void* operator new(size_t nSize, size_t nLength)
    {
        return malloc(nSize + nLength);
    }
};

struct TextCache : DynamicObject {...};
</code></pre>

<p>which looks a lot better, but would interfere with objects that already have overloads of new(it could even affect placement new...).</p>

<p>Finally I came up with placement new abusing:</p>

<pre><code>inline TextCache* CreateTextCache(size_t nLength)
{
    char* pNew = new char[sizeof(TextCache) + nLength];
    return new(pNew) TextCache;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This however is probably the worst idea so far, for quite a few reasons.</p>

<p>So are there any better ways to do this? or would one of the above versions be better, or at least improvable? Is doing even considered safe and/or bad programming practice?</p>

<hr>

<p>As I said above, I'm trying to avoid double allocations, because this shouldn't need 2 allocations, and cause this makes writing(serializing) these things to files a lot easier.
The only exception to the double allocation requirement I have is when its basically zero overhead. the only cause where I have encountered that is where I sequentially allocate memory from a fixed buffer(<a href=""http://necrolis.pastebin.com/g2fN3FSz"" rel=""nofollow"">using this system</a>, that I came up with), however its also a special exception to prevent superflous copying.</p>

<li><p>How is it decided which buffers would be in external memory, which ones would be allocated in internal SRAM, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>If FileOutputStream.write() was NOT thread safe, I would have to write additional code to make a file accessed by only thread at a time. Therefore, I used FileChannel.lock() to do so. However, different from the JDK document it does not block but throw an OverlappingFileLockException.</p></li>

I have dual monitors and they work as two seperate desktops, each with its own panel. The only 'communication' between them is that I can use the mouse to move the mouse pointer between them, other than that, neither monitor/desktop seems to 'know' that the other exists. I don't like having to grab the mouse just to move the pointer from one monitor/desktop to the other, particularly just to move focus from an xterm on one monitor/desktop to an xterm on the other monitor/desktop. I'm wondering if there might be some way of doing this via a keyboard shortcut. Alt+Tab does <em>not</em> do it, it only cycles between open windows on each desktop. Alt+Ctrl+Arrow does <em>not</em> do it, I can only cycle between workspaces on the current monitor/desktop. </p>

<p>The 'keyboard' section of 'Preferences' lets me enable using the keypad to move the mouse pointer, but, again, it will not move the mouse pointer off one monitor/desktop and onto the other one (in fact it crashes if I try to move the mouse pointer off the larger of the two monitors).</p>

<p>Can it be done? I notice that each open xterm has it's own unique number regardless of which monitor/desktop it is on, so the xterms 'know' about the xterms on the other monitor/desktop. If I had some way of shortcutting to xterms via their number, that would be just fine. Or, some shortcut which moves the mouse pointer off one monitor/desktop and onto the other would also work.</p>

The algorithms involve constructing a suffix array for a string that is the concatenation of a set of given strings with string separators called sentinels. So for example, if we are given the strings a, b and c, a new string d is created which is a$1b$2c$3 where $1, $2, $3 are the sentinel characters marking the ends of each string. The sentinel characters must be unique and lexicographically less than all other characters in a, b and c. </p>

<p>My question revolves around the representation of the sentinel characters in Python. If a, b and c are ASCII strings, I'm thinking I might need to convert those strings to UTF-8 and shift their range from 0-127 to a higher range such that there are characters available that are lexicographically less than those in the strings. If that seems reasonable, what is the most efficient mechanism for remapping the characters in Python such that their range is N-127+N where N is the number of strings provided? </p>

In SharePoint this involves an ActiveX control which pops up a dialog, and within this the user opens another dialog to select a certificate, followed by ticking an acceptance checkbox and clicking ""sign""</p>

<p>Management feels that this signing process is too complex for some users to understand (especially when it comes to getting people to accept the new system)</p>

<p>This actually works but at the end I'm having this display glitch that the animation gets removed (UIView layer jumps back to original position) and instantly calls the delegate method, which makes it jump to the end position.</p>

The problem is when I curl the page to get the hash, and when I include it as the post value in my next curl call (to the same page), the hash is not valid anymore since the succeeding curl cal is like the page refreshed already and it regenerated a new hash.</p>

<p>So how do I get the hash without simulating a refreshed page?</p>

6037185,probability coin toss,"<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/eUAtx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I am working on some homework questions and I am done everything except this one last question which I am stuck at. I am uncertain of how I can explain or find the probability in this case. I had a similar question where I just tossed a normal coin and they asked the probability to get heads or tails and that was relatively easy but with this one I am not sure..I have tried reading some other coin toss probability questions on this forum but they arent similar to this at all. </p>

<p>Firstly I dont even understand the question because of how complicated it is.
All I understand is there are 1000 ""items"" with 11 ""items"" inside each of these 1000 items.
Then I am clueless.</p>

<p>After your explanation Ross I was able to do 5i) and I think I did it right I am unsure on induction as that is my weak point.</p>

<p>5i) This question in a simpler form is asking what is the chance that all the coin tosses turn out heads or all the coin tosses turn out tails for a set A1. This means (1/2) (1/2)(1/2) (1/2)(1/2) (1/2) (1/2)(1/2) (1/2)(1/2) (1/2) which is (1/2)^11. This means the probability to get heads 11 times in a row is (1/2)^11. Now there is also a probability of our interest that all the coins turn out tails. The probability that all coin tosses turn out tails is exactly the same as the probability that all coin tosses turn out heads. Which means our probability to have ALL heads or ALL tails is all heads OR all tails. Namely, (1/2)^11+(1/2)^11 is our probability to have all red or all blue since heads and tails correspond to the colors.</p>

6037187,Constrain values in a table using values of a column in another table,"<p>So I have two tables:</p>

<pre><code>Requests
--------
Id
RequestSchemeId
ReceivedByUserId

ForwardedRequests
-----------------
Id
RequestId (FK to Id column of Requests Table)
ForwardedToUserId
</code></pre>

<p>Now one business rule says that a user can receive only one Request for a particular RequestScheme. So I created a UniqueKey constraint for RequestSchemeId+ReceivedByUserId. Which should solve my problem</p>

<p>The second business rule is that request can be forwarded to another user only if forwarded user does not already have a forwarded request under the same scheme from any other user. </p>

<p>The solution I can think of is a RequestSchemeId column in the ForwardedRequests table which is just a copy of the value in the related row of the Requests table and then add a unique constraint on ForwardedToUserId+RequestSchemeId.</p>

<p>Is this the correct way of doing it? If not what is?</p>

<p>How do I get value of the RequestSchemeId from Requests to ForwardedRequests when a new row is created in the latter? UDF is something I looked at but it seemed to have some gotchas and I need the standard/recommended way of doing this not something flaky. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If you don't give a faulted task the opportunity to propagate its

<p>The service keeps on running fine when that is called.</p>

<p>According to the docs, the finalizer of the Task will rethrow the exception once the Task is GC'd but this does not appear to happen. MSDN states repeatedly that normal "".NET exception policy"" results in process termination.</p>
